# esdn-provider-data
This repository contains samples of xml data pulled via OAI from ESDN's data providers. These are the files we use when writing and testing stylesheets, and so we make them available here in the hopes that they might be useful.

Please feel free to contact jmignault@metro.org with any questions or suggestions you might have. Thanks!
