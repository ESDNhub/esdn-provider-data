<dc:description>Dr. Kendall graduated from Geneva Medical College in 1844 and practiced medicine in three towns in Central New York: Pulaski, Clay and then Baldwinsville. He was also very active in the Onondaga and Oswego Medical Societies. Dr. Mercer was a junior member of the same class, graduating in 1943, and was a well-known, highly respected physician and medical educator in Syracuse, NY. The obituary also contains a description of the state of medical education in the mid-1800s, as compared to the beginning of the 20th century when the address was delivered.</dc:description>
