<dc:description>Inside Freeport
BROUGHT TO VOV BY THE OFFICE OF IHSVOR UNDREW HARDWICK
S U M M E R 2011
Moody&#x27;s Gives Mayor Hardwick an &quot;A+&quot; on Village&#x27;s Finances
While the federal government&#x27;s fiscal condition continues to
suffer setbacks and other municipalities face similar struggles all
across the country, including Long Island, the same cannot be said
for the Village of Freeport, which recently received an A-l bond
rating from Moody&#x27;s with a stable outlook on its overall finances.
In the report, Moody&#x27;s cited Freeport&#x27;s improved budgetary
practices and systems implemented by the new administration of
Mayor Andrew Hardwick and indicated it expects the village&#x27;s oper-ating
results will stabilize in fiscal 2011 and 2012.
&quot;We are extremely pleased that Moody&#x27;s recognized the
tremendous efforts we have made concerning Freeport Village&#x27;s
budgetary policies,&quot; said Mayor Andrew Hardwick. &quot;Despite inher-iting
a massive deficit at the start of my administration, we have
quickly gotten spending under control and the village&#x27;s financial well
-being is finally back on the right track.&quot;
Moody&#x27;s also acknowledged the village&#x27;s efforts to reduce
expenditures by 10 percent in its 2011 budget and Freeport&#x27;s projec-tions
to restore reserve funds to historical norms in fiscal 2012 by
addressing revenue shortfalls that resulted from over-budgeting by
the previous administration. Among the significant initiatives carried
out by Mayor Hardwick that helped decrease village expenses were:
• Enacting a freeze on discretionary spending
• Worked with unions to stabilize costs, secure jobs and
save taxpayers money on salaries paid to village em-ployees
• Aggressively pursuing available state and federal grants
that have resulted in millions of dollars in additional
money pledged to the Village of Freeport
In addition, the Moody&#x27;s report reacted favorably to the
village working toward reducing borrowing for tax certiorari judg-ments,
all positive fiscal practices that helped contribute to Moody&#x27;s
upbeat conclusions.
&quot;During these tough economic times we have made the dif-ficult
decisions necessary to help restore and improve Freeport&#x27;s fi-nancial
health by cutting spending and exercising sound fiscal poli-cies.&quot;
Hardwick said. &quot;It certainly hasn&#x27;t been easy. All of us are
being asked to do more with less. However, in the long run I am
confident our approach will work in the best interests of all of our
residents and business community,&quot; Hardwick concluded.

Fiscal Year
At the start of Mayor Hardwick&#x27;s administration, Freeport had one of
the highest debt levels of any village in New York State, according to
the NYS Comptroller&#x27;s Office. Under Mayor Hardwick&#x27;s leadership and
sound fiscal policies, Freeport&#x27;s overall debt has been significantly
reduced and the village has stabilized its budget.

JREEPORT ELECTRIC HONORED
NATIONALLY
Freeport Electric, known by most residents as the &quot;Electric Department,&quot; has been named one of the top performing utilities in
the nation by the American Public Power Association. The award, given annually to the elite of the nation&#x27;s more than 2,000
municipal and non-profit power agencies, went to just 82 utilities this year. &quot;These RP3 designated utilities should be proud&quot;,
said APPA Review Panel Chairman Paul Allen in awarding Freeport the title of Reliable Public Power Provider (RP3).
This is a real honor for our utility,&quot; said Superintendent Anthony Fiore of Freeport Electric. &quot;A lot of hard work has gone into
receiving this designation and— in the end—our customers are the real winners.&quot;
The RP3 program recognizes public power utilities that demonstrate proficiency in four key disciplines: reliability, safety, work-force
development and system improvement. Criteria within each category are based on sound business practices and represent
a utility-wide commitment to safe and reliable delivery of electricity. &quot;We&#x27;ve done quite a bit of work over the last few years in
all those areas,&quot; Superintendent Fiore said. &quot;But, of course, the purpose was to provide the kind of electric service to the citizens
of Freeport that they deserve and have grown accustomed to.&quot;
This tcp level reccanltlcn Is a special reflection cf the reliable public power avail-able
riant here In Freepcrt. Whether It&#x27;s a visit tc your Heine, aettlna you con-nected,
cr Just a friendly voice en the phone, ycu can ccunt en us* We&#x27;re busy
ma kino sure ycu acn&#x27;t have tc worry abcut details like utility service as ycu ac
about ycur typical day. Cf course, we&#x27;re always happy tc help when you need us.

BOS FRANCHISES
. The Board of Trustees has recently approved franchises for the oper-ation
of buses through the Village of Freeport in conformity with routes out - &#x27;
lined by the Nassau County Dept. of Franchises to provide more adequate serv.
ice. First route covers Freeport to Bellmore run operated by Star Bus lines.
Inc. , for operation along Henry Street between the Bus Terminal and Broadway
Grand Avenue between North Main St. and North Columbus Avenue ;N6rth Col-umbus
between East&#x27;Seaman Avenue and Village line at Babylon Turnpike, at
or near Forest Avenue. .The second route is for operation of buses by Utili-ty
I_&gt;ines,Inc. on Freeport to Amityville run. Operation in the Village calls for
Henry Street between the Bus Terminal and Merrick Road;route will then fol-low
Merrick Road - which is a County highway - eastward.
FIREMEN&#x27;S MEMORIAL&#x27;FIELD ..&#x27;.&#x27;L- :
In conformity with a resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees last
year, work is proceeding on construction of a practice and tournament field for
use of the Freeport Fire Department, in the eastern area adjoining Meadow-brook
Causeway. It is anticipated that work will be substantially finished by
the Fall to make it possible for the Fire Department, to have facilities avail-able
for training purposes and for carrying on of,tournaments.
ROAD IMPROVEMENT
A dangerous jog in the roadway at Broadway, North Columbus and Par-sons
Avenues is being eliminated by joint action of the County Department of
Public Works and the Village. Title has been taken to a triangular piece of pro-perty
which will make it possible to eliminate the sharp curve at that point at
which numerous accidents have occurred and serious catastrophe on several
occasions narrowly been avoided. The re-designing of the road will provide
ample room for operations. Since both North Columbus Avenue south of Grand
Avenue, and Broadway are County roads, the work on these streets is being .
done under the County auspices&#x27;. - . • . . . &#x27;
SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION
If you are thinking of having a new sidewalk and curb constructed, be
sure the contractor is one who is licensed by the Village, and is duly bonded.
Otherwise, if his work does not prove satisfactory you will have.not redress.
The Village, through its Village Engineers-Baldwin &amp; Cornelius Co. , has set
up specifications for sidewalk construction and fixed grade elevations, which
must be observed. A call to the Village Clerk will give you complete details.
HEDGES on STREET CORNERS
The Village Clerk reports that with the waning days of summer,he has
received several complaints regarding overgrown hedges and shrubs at street
intersections. He requests that all bushes within 20 feet of the curb line at
corners more than 3 feet in height from street grade be trimmed back to rran
imize traffic hazards, in compliance with the law.

library, details of whose operation will be published later. The new ac-
cessory building will be of stucco construction and will be located immediately
north of the Memorial Library building.
- VILLAGE VETERAN
Chris Jarvis, a maintenance mechanic at the power plant, is the oldest
worker for the Village of Freeport, in point of service. He entered the employ
of the Village on August 15, 1909 and, with the exception of a brief interval, has
served during the intervening forty-three years. Chris&#x27;s first job was as a fir e
man in the power plant in 1909, which was then operated by steam. At that time,
;he was one of four employees, and electricity was produced by the power sup -
plied by two engines which, with the dynamos attached, had a total capacity of
about 150 KW per hour. The power plant passed from vertical steam-operated
to horizontal boilers and later to its present type of operation, with oil-burning
diesel engines. Chris suffered an accident a few days ago, and, while tempor-arily
on leave of absence, is expected to return to work soon.
- KNOW YOUR HYDRANTS
All 840 of the hydrants in the Village have received a &quot;spic and span&quot;
coat of yellow paint -not only to protect them against the weather but also to in
dicate the available amount of water at each hydrant. This is for the conveni -
ence of the fire department, in making hose connections at fires.
So that you may know your hydrants, the red top indicates that the hy-drant
carries a 4&#x27;inch supply line, the yellow indicates a 6 inch supply line arid
the green top indicates a supply line of 8 inches or more. For visibility at the
night time, strips of luminous tape are being placed around the caps.
BIG ENGINE ARRIVES &#x27; .
The new Baldwin -Lima -Hamilton diesel engine, &quot;which is to supply the
Village with 3100 K. W. per hour of additional electricity, has come to town.
The arrival of the giant motor which weighs one-half million pounds, presented
an unusual problem in transportation. There are few pieces of automotive eq-uipment
of size capable of handling such a weighty piece of machinery. When
the apparatus was rolled from the freight yards down the Sunrise Highway to
the Power Plant, it attracted much attention. It has since been placed on its
concrete foundation and the remaineder of its installation is proceeding. The
engine-generator will be capable of carrying one-third of the average load of
electricity used in the Village. In the meantime, however, the use of electri-city
is increasing so rapidly that further additions are. in prospect.

WATER
Water -One of Nature&#x27;s greatest gifts.
Men have died for want of it, fought and died to acquire it.
Long Island is blessed with water at its best.
Filtered by. Nature and in ample quantity.
Ample will be the supply, just as long as we use it with discretion.
&quot;Waste not - want not. &quot;
The Village Water Department has kept pace with the ever increasing
growth of the community and times. The cost of operation has increased from
100%to 200% over the past twenty years, which presents a real challange to the
Department&#x27;s operation, as the present water rates were established in 1927.
It appears inevitable th at a slight increase will be mandatory in the near future.
The conservation of water will not only protect the supply, but will help to keep
down the cost of operation. •

<dc:description>Cost of current consumed, at the minimum rate?
$19.338.45
Does the Water Department use. seasonal workers?
Yes, in line extensions, and such jobs as painting or cleaning of
water towers, painting of hydrants, and making technical repairs.
What was the total payroll in 1951?
$44,000. 00
What was the cost of pipes and other materials needed for line
extensions and repairs in 1951?
$69, 000.00
What were the gross receipts from water rentals in 1951?
$149,92Z.94
Where does the water in the wells come from?
From the.rains and snows that fall on the -ground.
What is the annual precipitation?
About 42 inches per year, but it varies widely.-
Isn&#x27;t our supply fed by an underground river, which runs south-ward-
from New England?
No. The contours of the rock formations make such a flow im-possible.
Where then does the underground water originate?
Solely from the rain and snow that fall on Long Island itself.
Does this point to a need for conservation?
Yes, because as more houses are built, more streets are paved,
and other natural conditions are disturbed, the less &quot;water gets
into the ground, while our increase in populationmakes demands
on the supplies in more increasing quantities.
Has Long Island water run dry at any point?
Yes; in Brooklyn - the underground supplies have been drained
away, and.wells once abundant are dry today.
Is full information on the subject of Long Island&#x27;s water supplies
available ? . &quot;
Yes, you can get details&quot; from-the New York State Conservation
Department in Albany, New York. &quot; -&quot;

M. E. U. A. CONVENTION
The twenty second annual conference of the Municipal Electric Util-ities
Association of New York State was held at Saranac Inn,New York, on
September-24th, 25th, b 26th, 1952. The largest attendance in the history of
the Association was recorded at this conference. Many papers of interest were
presented by speakers outstanding in their respective professions. The Vil-lage
of Freeport was one of the charter members of M. E. U. A. and over the
years has had the honor of having several of its officials elected to office in
the Association. At this year&#x27;s session. Trustee Leonard&quot; D. B. Smith was
elected as one of the Vice Presidents, and Comptroller Milford F. VanRiper
was re-elected Secretary; both will serve on the Executive Committee. The
M. E. U.A. is one of the outstanding Associations in the nation in promoting
the welfare of municipally-owned electric systems.
FROM A&quot;SATISFIED READER
T o the Inc. Village of Freeport, ..
I wish to compliment you on the monthly &quot;Freeport&quot; news bulletin,
and I am sure that it-is read by.every resident. In 1945 I moved my business
to-Freeport, after looking around in several villages on Long Island and New
. Jersey. , ;.. .. A&#x27;iew months ago, I bought my home here, although we rented
an apartment&#x27;until then.on Lillian Avenue, Freeport. My family and I find
this Village to be very friendly. ..... Living here has certainly been a pleas-ure,
and enjoyable to all my family and to myself.
Yours truly,
Frank Wiesenfeld (Signed)

A TALK ABOUT FUSES
Scene: House full of company, television goind full blast, lots of fun
and suddenly, complete blackness A FUSE HAS BURNED OUT. Poss-ibly
some laughter,but certainly considerable annoyance. Manyfolks become
very much annoyed when a fuse is burned out, when in&#x27; reality, they should be
very thankful, for without such afuse the house could be easilyset afire. Most
folks do not understand that electric wires, covered with insulation, have a
limited capacity as to the amount of electric current such wire can carry be-fore
it becomes red hot and starts a fire. The purpose of the fuse is to have
that fuse burn out when the wire gets too hot for safety, and thus shut off the
current from an overloaded wire, and prevent fire in some other place.
The electric wiring in a building is laid out in circuits, each ordinary
circuit beinglimited to 1500 watts or 15 amperes. When such a circuit is car-rying
its full load, if one additional light or one additional appliance is turned
on ... Out goes the fuse. Some people, in ignorance, think it wise after hav-ing
a fuse burn out to put in a fuse which is designed to carry more than 1500
watts (ISamperes) and in so doing unwittingly risk setting the house afire. Al-so,
there are some people who insert a copper penny in the place where the
15 ampere fuse should go, but they sometimes fail to realize that if the house
catches fire because the wires get too hot, they not only suffer the annoyance
of a fire, but may also find out that the insurance company will refuse to pay
such a loss.
If the reader has had trouble with fuses burning out, it is urged that
one of the many licensed electricians in the Village be called in to checkup on
the wiring system; a service usually rendered without charge. In the past ten
years so many new electrical appliances have come into common use, that it
is safe to say that for complete safety from fire such a check up should be
made in every house erected before.1940. A house having an electric cooking
stove, or an automatic washing machine, probably has been checked.
It is not .the responsibility of the Village Electric Department to re-place
burned out fuses; that is the responsibility of the consumer. The res-ponsibility
of the Village--or any public utility company--ends when the cur-rent
is brought to the panel box in which the fuses belong. Keep a supply of
15 ampere fuses on hand; they cost but a few cents each. It is proper to use
a 30 ampere fuse above the mainline service switch which is usually mounted
adjacent to the circuit panels or branch circuit fuses. Some persons are afraid
to touch a panel box thinking they might get a shock. There can be no possi-ble,
danger in changing fuses, if the main switch is pulled out.
* * * * * * * * * *
POWER HOUSE EXPANSION
Work is progressing rapidly on the installation of the new 3300 K.W.
diesel powered electric generator in the Municipal Power Plant. As a neces-sary
adjunctan elaborate new handle and switch mechanism has been ordered.
It is anticipated that it will be in place so far as to permit the new unit to be
ready for operation early next Spring. Part of the new equipment includes a
3000 barrel tank for the storage of fuel oil. The new engine is of modern type
capable of utilizing fuel of the cheaper grades which.it is anticipated, will re-sult
in considerable savings in the way of operating the Plant.

THE WATER WE USE
An important part of Village administration is providing for the pro-duction,
distribution and conservation of water. Freeport operates its own
system, and the profits (expressed largely in the form of low water rates) go
directly to the taxpayers. Costs of production and maintenance have risen in
these inflationary days. The idea that there is plenty of water available and
that all we have to do is to reach out and take it practically at no cost, is not
in conformity with the facts. A few questions and answers will help make this
clear.
Q. How many wells supply Freeport with water?
A. Six.
Q.
A.
In what sections of the Village are they?
Two west; four east.
Q. How deep are they?
A. 525 feet.
Q. What is the capacity of each, daily?
A. 1, 140, 000 gallons.
Q. How has the use of water grown?
A. In 1941 - 629,861,974 gallons
1946 - 727, 126,108 gallons
1951-819,813.812 gallons.
Q. How much is used in extinguishing fires?
A. 6,000,000 gallons per year.
Q. How are the wells operated?
A. By electric pumps.
Q. Where does the electricity come from?
A. Our municipal electric plant.

<dc:description>LATERAL SEWER DISTRICT 6-A
The Freeport Sewer Commission has established, in response to petitions
of more than 51% of property, owners, a lateral sewer district designated 6-A, com-prising
the area south of Atlantic Avenue and west of-South Bayview Avenue. Bids
were received by the Sewer Commissiqnon June 6th, and the contract has been awarded
to the low bidder. Mr. George Sammis, .and upon the contract being signed, -the work
will&#x27;proceed immediately and, barring unforseen &#x27;interruptions, will .be in operation
in the Fall and completed by December 15, 1952. .
. FREEPORT HOUSING AUTHORITY
It was with a sense of keen regret that Mayor Robert L. Doxsee and the mem-ber
s&#x27;of the Freeport Housing Authority accepted the resignation of Rev. C. NewmanHogle
whose transfer-to other parochial duties necessitated his retirement from the Housing
Authority.
Benjamin J. Reiner, prominent in civic affairs,&#x27; and at present the Exalted
Ruler of the B; P. O. E. of Freeport, was appointed by Mayor Doxsee to fill Rev. Hogle &#x27; a
place on the Housing Authority. .
USE OF WATER
ORDINANCE 130 - No fountain, hose bib or sprinkler shall be in use on any
day except between the hours of 6:00 A.M. and 8:00 A. M., and between 6:00 P.M. and
9:00 P.M.
By order of the Mayor and Board of Trustees.
DOGS RUNNING AT LARGE
Attention is directed to the considerable number of dogs running at large,
especiallyin the early morning hours. &#x27;Most residences in Freeport are .without fences
enclosing the property and dogs running loose damage gardens- and shrubbery and be-come
a cause of complaints; .&#x27;
A Village Ordinance provides that dogs are not allowed to run at large, and
provides a fine -as a penalty therefor. Further, the Village has contracted with the
Long Island Humane Society providing for the collection by it, of dogs running through
the streets. If a dog is picked up by the Society&#x27;s wagon, a. lee of $2. 00 for redemption
is. charged, and if not redeemed, the dog may be destroyed, or other wise disposition
made of it. . .
This matter is especially called to the attention of dog owners inorder that
you may comply with the provisions of the ordinance and not lose your dog to the dog
pound.
OBSERVANCE OF MEMORIAL DAY .
As in the past, Memorial Day was observed in our Village with an impressive
parade followed by solemn Memorial Rites at the Municipal Stadium.
Samuel -D, Gerber -was again the Grand Marshall and through his efforts and
with the cooperation of his many aides, the assembling of the many organizations and
equipment for the parade was accomplished with unusual smoothness.
Freeport&#x27;s own Fire Department turned put in large numbers, and the Fire
Department Band is one of the finest.
At the Stadium, Mayor Robert L. Doxsee gave a patriotic address in which
he asserted people of the present day do not appreciate the benefits handed down to
them by .their forefathers and called for a rebirth of Americanism.
. &#x27; Cyril C. Ryan, Nassau County director of Civil Defense, also spoke and
.urged all to join the Civil Defense organization to be prepared to help in case of need.
Harry J. Chuisano,- Vice-Commander, and now Commander of - William
Clinton Story Post of the American Legion, also Freeport&#x27;s Superintendent of Highways
and Sanitation, gave the Memorial address in the absence of Commander Frederick W.
Batcher, while Commander Clifford Combes of Henry .Theodore Mohr Post spoke for
the Veterans of Foreign Wars. &#x27;
Ceremonies were concluded by the firing of three volleys by a squad from
the 142nd Heavy Tank Battalion followed by &quot;Taps&quot; and response sounded by buglers
from the Freeport High School Band. ...

FREEPORT&#x27;S PARK SYSTEM .
Definite progress will soon be made on the establishment of Freeport&#x27;s new
park system. Duringthe summer months nearly $125, 000. will be spent, part of which
will go to the preliminary construction of the Northeast. Park, and the other part for the
Waterfront Park-at the foot of Long.Beach Avenue.
The Northeast Park consists of some six or seven acres located in the area
of Parsons and Lakeview Avenues and Witmark Place. Soon to be installed is a basket-ball
court, .rinks for roller and ice skating, a four room administration building, and the
laying&#x27;out of paths and roadways.. -
The maximum.expenditure at the Waterfront Parkwill be to bulkhead 540 feet
of shore line behind which a twenty foot explanade will be constructed, also immediately
to be completed will be a turn-around traffic circle, and a parking area capable of con-taining
some eighty or ninety cars.
EX-MAYOR WINNE
The Board of Trustees at its regular June meeting adopted a resolution ex-pressing
regret at the death of Worden E. Wirine, who, several years ago, was, twice
elected trustee of the Village, and served one term as mayor starting with the year
1941. . The Board pointed out in the resolution the many fine works of public service
that had been accomplished by Mayor Winne under his administration.
. .SUMMER . CONCERTS—— - • *
The Boardof Trustees has grantedpermission, through the ParkCommission,
for the staging of concerts at the Municipal Park immediately south of the Municipal
Building on Ocean Avenue, and for Randall Park.
Concerts in the Municipal Park will be given on the following Wednesday
evenings; July 9th and 23rd, August 13th and 27th, and on the following Friday evenings
July 18th and August 1st and 15th.
The Concerts in Randall Park will be given Monday evenings, July 7th and
21st, and August 4th and 18th.

under direction of Mr. William Dayton, and by a girls band from the Adult Education
group under direction of Mr. William Dayton and Dr.. J. Maynard Wettlaufer, music
director of Freeport High School. The Adult Education group will provide the music for
all concerts .in Randall Park.
MULTIPLE RESIDENCE LAW
A new law adopted by the State of New York becomes effective on July 1st this
year. The law, passed for greater protection of the residents, makes it necessary to
observe certain conditions of fire protection and construction of dwellings housing several
families. The law is applicable both to old and new structures and applies to apartment
houses, hotels, lodging houses, schools, convalescent and nursing homes, and private
dwellings of two or more stories in height, with five or more boarders, roomers, or
lodgers.
The Village is required by the State authorities to cooperate in providing
information required to effectuate the law. Owners of premises of the kinds described
will confer a favor upon your Village if they make applications for registration forms
so that the necessary preliminaries may be taken to effectuate the law.
STATE CONFERENCE OF MAYORS
Headed by Mayor Robert L. Doxsee, a delegation of Village Trustees and
Village officials attended the annual meeting of the New York State Conference of
Mayors and public officials at Lake Placid June 10th to 13th. Various matters con-cerning
the lifting of the tax burden on residents, and getting greater advantage outof
the State Law, were taken up and discussed in detail. Village Counsel was appointed
Chairman of a committee to investigate certain aspects of law which were unfavorable
to Villages so that the Legislature might be petitioned to amend unfavorable conditions.
Those who attended the Conference, beside Mayor Doxsee, were Trustee
Cord Viebrock, Trustee Leonard D. B. Smith, Village Clerk Edmund T. Cheshire,
Village Counsel Martin H. Weyrauch and Village Comptroller Milford F. Van Riper.
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION
In spite of adverse factors in other communities the building construction
showed healthy signs during the past month in Freeport. Twenty-seven permits were
issued for new construction at a cost of $264, 600. , and twenty-three permits were
issued for additions and alterations to cost $22,315,
COMPLAINTS
Numerous complaints have be en filed with the Village Clerkthat overhanging
trees are interfering with passers-by on the sidewalk and with the driving of automo-biles
on roadways. A Village ordinance requires that all overhanging limbs shall be
•trimmed to at least eight feet over the center of sidewalks and thirteen feet over the
roadway. Five feet or more from the outer edge of the sidewalk. Owners of property
are requested to cooperate in seeing that the provisions of the ordinance are complied
with.
DEBRIS REMOVAL
Many requests have come to the Village Clerk for the removal of debris such
as tree limbs, grass clippings, sticks, and large accomulations of rubbish to be picked
up. Because of the large demands it is impossible to make collections of such large
accumulations as promptlyas might be desired. To facilitate collections, householders
are requested to place such debris of discarded materials, firmly tied, on the curb
Thursday night or early Friday morning so that a uniform collection scheme may be
brought about.
SCRAP METAL DRIVE
Joseph J. Darcy, District Engineer on Long Island for the StateDepartment
of Public Works, complimented the citizens of Freeport for their fine support of the-scrap
drive recently conducted by the William Clinton Story Post of the American
Legion with the cooperation of the Village administration. Forty-three tons of metal
were turned over to aid the cause of National Defense.
&quot;This by far tops what any other Village has done&quot;, Mr. Darcy said.
NEW WATER MAINS
An elaborate project of replacing leaky iron water mains in the southern
section of the Village has been completed at an over-all cost of approximately $100, 000.
Water mains laid a number of years ago in boggy land, were perforated by action of
the salt water and caused the loss of thousands of gallons of water. New pipes are
constructed of concrete and transite mix which are not subject to erosion and will be
a saving in lost water to the Village of thousands of dollars annually.

FIRE DEPARTMENT COMMENDED
The efficiency of the Freeport Volunteer Fire Department, was excellently
demonstrated on June 16th, when a&#x27;fire broke out in the annex being built to house the
new three-quarter million dollar engine at the Freeport Municipal Power Plant. Due
to the presence of elaborate electrical equipment, water could not beused to extinquish
the flamesandthe firemen s warmed over the building with chemical extinquishers along
beams and girders at a height of 75 feet from the ground to put out the blaze,which if
not efficiently handled might liave resulted in damage in a substantial amount.
Heading the force of fire fighters was Chief John Marra, installed in office
only a few weeks ago. The Board of Trustees passed a re solution complimenting Chief
Marra and his deputies and all of the members of the Fire Department for their effi-ciency.
Compliments were also extended to the power house employees under Supt.
William Tompkins, for their aid in extinquishing the blaze.
RANDALL PARK ACTIVITIES
During the past two weeks Randall Park has been the scene of much activity
enjoyed by young and old. The children from Archer Street and Columbus Avenue
Schools held their end-of-the-termpicnics, and the Freeport Senior Citizens, sponsor-ed
by the Freeport Community Council, had their Second Annual Outing in the Park. One
of the highlights of the season atthe Park was on June 19th when the Freeport office of
the Internal Revenue Bureau played Softball against Glen Cove office of the Bureau. The
final score was - Freeport 16; Glen Cove 4. The Park is available for similar use by
civic groups. Apply to Park Commission for permits.
REVOLVER MATCH
On June 28th from 10:00 A. M. until 4:00 P.M. the Freeport Municipal Stad-ium
Pistol Range will witness some expert marksmanship demonstrated by members of
our Freeport Police Department and neighboring Villages, the F.B.I. , and the State
Police. Spectators are invited to &quot;drop in&quot; and watch the action.
LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL
A meeting was held in the Village Office on June 16th attended byrepresen-tatives
of the Freeport Park Commission, the Board of Trustees and the Committee en
the Little League Baseball project. Your Village, through the Park Commission, has

WEED CLEARING APPROVED
The following letter was recently received by the Board of Trustees:
Gentlemen: .
There were many favorable comments expressed at our last
monthly meeting about the work of the Highway Department in cleaning weeds
in the southern part of the Village this summer. We wish to express our thanks
to the Board for its cooperation in helping to correct this dangerous and un-healthy
condition.

The Atlantic South Civic Association.
CLEARING OUT THE VILLAGE ATTIC
For more than 58 years the Village Office has been accumulating pub-lic
records, none of which could be destroyed because the law of the State of
New York forbade it. It is not commonly known. But even every letter written
to the Village becomes a public record, as well as the reply to it. In 1951-
the Legislature passed a law which provides that with the consent of the State
Commissioner of Education certain types of records may be destroyed after
having been kept for a specified length of time. Many types of records have
to be kept forever, such as assessments of real estate, deeds, certain books
of financial records, and all records having historical, legal or fiscal value.
As rapidly as possible, the Commissioner of Education issues printed
instructions covering in detail the various types of records and the length of
time they must be kept. So far, the Village has been authorized to destroy dog
licenses issued prior to 1950, various types of other licenses issued prior to
1946, certain types of records of the Water Department kept prior to 1946,
and fire insurance policies which expired before 1946. Instructions covering
ordinary correspondence and many other types of records are yet to come.
It is quite a job to clear our Village attic. John F.DeLorme, former
Village Trustee, is in charge of the operation.
FREEPORT
The Village Clerk has recently received notification from the State
Insurance Fund that the Village is one of the winners in the 1952 State Fund
Safety Competition.

Thomas W. Cann, Project Manager, will be in the office daily. It is
suggested that all inquiries relative to the housing project be made of Mr .-Cann.
Telephone service will be installed within very short time. Number will have
to be obtained by calling &quot;INFORMATION&quot; - not the Village Office.
NEW STATION PLAZA
Steps to speed up the railroad grade crossing elimination project in
Freeport has been given impetus by plans of Senator John Bennett andAssem-blyman
Joseph Carlino to use their efforts in the Legislature to secure funds
for the carrying out of the project at the next session of the Legislature. In
the meantime, the Village has recently acquired a substantial piece of prop-erty
immediately east of Henry Street and south of the railroad tracks for the
purpose of the station plaza development. The property was acquired from the
Tri-Williams Associates. The entire project has been delayed due to inter-national
emergency conditions.
STEPS of VILLAGE GROWTH
WATER - The water system of the Village was begun in 1894, when $35,000
bonds were sold. That sum covered the laying of five miles of pipe, 75 fire
hydrants, a building to house the steam boilers and two 70 H. P. engines,and
in its first year of operation 99 customers were served.
Today, water is served to 6997 customers and in addition the Village
is supplied with water without cost to the taxpayers for many purposes, such
as flushing sewers, for all Village -owned public buildings and 840 fire hy-drants.
If the fire hydrants were supplied with water by a private water com-pany
it would cost the taxpayers at least $42,000 per year. Qualified experts
say that our excellent -water system and our efficient Fire Department save our
residents $2,750,000 each year in reduced fire insurance premiums.
Since its beginning, the Village has issued bonds in the amount of
$965,000 for the water system. The Auditor&#x27;s report, as of Feb. 29, 1952,
shows that the system has assets of $1,114,116.67 after deducting the sum of
$777, 717. 89 for depreciation.
ELECTRICITY - The Electric Department was started in 1897 with proceeds
from a bond issue of $20,000. Power to generate current was had from a 70
H. P. engine, and during the first year of operation had 28 customers. Today
the department has 8,791 customers, and in addition furnishes light for all
Village-owned public buildings and to 1066 ordinary street lights and 199 orn-amental
street lights without cost to the taxpayers.
Since its beginning to December 5, 1951, bonds for the development
of this department have been issued in the amount of $836,000. The rep&#x27;ort of
the Auditor, as of Feb. 29, 1952, shows that this department has assets of
$2, 761, 108. 24 after deducting $1,476, 240. for depreciation.
PAVED ROADS - In 1911 and 1921, twenty years after the Village was incor-porated,
the voters approved$65,000 for paving certain roads with &quot;Peekskill
gravel&quot;. From 1926 to 1933 the Village sold bonds in the sum of $1,217.000
for permanent paving of our streets. All of those bonds have been paid off.
SEWERS - Over a period of years the property owners of the Village refused
four times to vote funds for a sewer system. Finally,.at the fifth election held
in 1926, a favorable vote (by 15 votes)was had and, today, the greater part of
the Village is sewered. Cost to date - $2, 574, 000.
From the date of its incorporation in 1892 up to and including 1922,
(the first thirty years of its corporate existence) the Village had issued bonds
in the amount of $486,000. Since 1922 it has issued bonds, up to December 4,
1951, in the amount of $7,721,600 for a grand total of $8, 207, 600.
FIRE DEPARTMENT WALKIE-TALKIES
The Board of Trustees adopted a resolution to provide modernequip-ment
for the Fire Department to increase the efficiency of its operation. Under
the di rections of the resolution, the Chief of the Fire Dept. is authorized to ac-quire
one two-way radio set foruse of the Deputy Chief and two walkie-talkies
with which toequip the firemen for efficient service in the performance of their
duties. The need for such equipment was brought out at a recent fire on the
roof of the extension to the Municipal Power Plant where the firefighters were
some eighty feet above the ground and the transmission of signals by short-wave
would have facilitated operations.

- VILLAGE ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION
The Village of Freeport is getting ready to celebrate the sixtieth-anniversary
of its incorporation-.aneventwhich took place onOctober22,1892.
A citizens&#x27; committee has been formed and the Village will participate o f—
ficially in the ceremonies. Details will be announced later. Marty items of
interest have been found as result of research in the Village&#x27;s back files by
John F.DeLorme , former Village Trustee, who has been retained by the Vil-lage
Board to go through papers of past years with the idea of clearing the
files of the large accumulation of such materials as is of no value and class
ifying those which are of permanent record. Mr. DeLorme, inhis research
of the Village affairs.has this to report on the subject of the original incor-poration:
An election was held on October 18,1892, and 346 voters cast their
ballots on the question of incorporation, 214 voted in favor and 132 voted a-,
gainst the idea. Four days later, on October22, 1892 the Supervisor of the
Town of Hempstead and the Town Clerk filed a certificate ( to the effect that
they had supervised the election) in the office of County Clerk, in Jamaica
for at that time Freeport was in the County of Queens.
Then followed the usual campaign for election to office. ..... the
election taking place onNovember29,1892 from 12p&#x27;clock&#x27;Noon to 4o&#x27;clock-
&quot;~&quot;iri~-the~ afternoon,and the voting took place in theFireTruck Company house
on Church Street. The election was for a Village President, a Trustee fora
two year term and two Trustees for a one year term.
The first meeting of the Freeport Village Board was held on Dec-ember6,1892,
with Mr.Carman Cornelius, Village President,presiding. The
Board appointed a Village Clerk and fixed his salary at $40. 00 per year. La-ter
they increased the salary to$12. 50 per month, and by 1900,&quot;it had risen
&#x27; to $25.00 per&#x27; month. . . .
-Within a few weeks after the Village Board was elected, it had con-sulted
an engineer Charles A. Lockwood... about a water plant. Indeed .
within two years after its incorporation, the Village Board:had sold approx-imate
ly $43, 000 in bonds for a water system for Freeport and about $5, 000
. for fire apparatus. . &#x27; . . . . - • •,. :
These.were the first steps of the new Village toward the bi^ com-munity
it has since become. . -
VILLAGE ORDINANCES
The local affairs of the Village are governed by laws on the local
level which are designated as ordinances. All ordinances of the Village are
adopted by the Board of Trustees, but only after a public hearing has been held
and all persons interested have had an opportunity to express their opinions.
At the present time the Village is engaged in a re-adoption of its entire system
of ordinances into a unified code for purposes of clearer understanding and to
eliminate the number of conflicts that have developed during the years. This
new code will be adopted as a result of several hearings that have been held
and will be published some time within the next several months.
FIRES on VACANT LOTS
The Fire Department has been called out frequently during the past
month to extinguish fires on vacant lots. These fires are usually caused by
accumulation of dry grass, weeds, brush, paper cartons and other materials
of an inflamable nature. To prevent damage to adjacent property. Village Or-dinance
No. 166 requires the owners of property to keep their vacant land free
of such materials. The Village Clerk requests cooperation of all residents,
to have the provisions of .the ordinance complied with. This will notonly elim
inate the fire hazard but add to the attractiveness of the Village, and very sub-stantially
to the value of the property.
VILLAGE BOARD MEETINGS
Public meetings of the Village Board of Trustees during the month
of JUNE, JULY, AUGUST and September, are held only on the second Mon -
day of these months. To insure that matters requiring attention are surely
placed on the calendar, the same should be in the hands of the Village Clerk
not later than 4:00 P. M. on the Friday preceding the meeting.
POLICE CHIEFS CONVENTION
Chief Peter Elar and Ptl. Joseph Romeika attended the Convention
of New York State Police Chiefs held in Utica, N. Y. .from July 22nd to 25th
1952. The purpose of participating in this convention is to become informed
of the latest and most modern trends for police departments. Discussions in
elude better methods for the prevention of crime and juvenile delinquency, and
advances made in lessening of traffic congestion and accidents; the&lt;application
of which as concerns Freeport, makes a Police Department abreast of curreit
methods and results in a minimum of crime and traffic hazards.
KNOW YOUR ZONING BOARD of APPEALS
The Zoning Board of Appeals in the Village of Freeport is an inte-gral
part of our Village government, entrusted with the safe guarding of op -
erations of the zoning ordinance.
This Board is comprised of business and professional men selected
by the Village Board of Trustees. We would like to present to the residents
of Freeport - F. Gordon Edwards, Chairman, presently who holds anexecu-tive
position with the New York Telephone Company as engineer in charge of
.underground cables; George Maislen, attorney; Walter Miranda .Regional Man
ager of the Kitchen Maid Sales Corp.; Randolph Eareckson, accountant with
Republic Aviation Corp.; and George J.Smith, Mechanical Engineer, General
Sales Manager and Secretary of the Columbian Bronze Corporation.
This Board operates in much the same way as a court, in the follow
ing manner: An individual applies to the Building Department for a permit to
erect a structure, or otherwise use his premises in some way not in strict
compliance with the Village Building Code and for that reason his application
is refused. If the applicant desires to make the alteration despite denial, he
has the right to file an appeal to the Zoning Board requesting that the decision
of the Superintendent of Buildings be set aside and approval to his application
be granted. His case will be put on the calendar, and taken up at a public heap-ing
held on the third Wednesday of the next month, by tlie Zoning Board. Tes-timony
is taken concerning the reasons why the applicant feels he is entitled
to a variance from the restrictions as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. Up-on
presenting sufficient and reasonable evidence to prove a practical difficulty
or legal hardship, and that by such alteration of the requirements of the Build -
ing Code the public welfare will not be jeopardized, the Zoning Board has the
right to grant a variance from the strict letter of the Zoning Code. However,
if in their judgment, the alteration would be detrimental to the area involved
they have the right to deny such appeal.
To insure the rights of the neighbors adjacent to the property where
the proposed alteration is to be made the Board of Appeals requires service
by mail, ten days before the hearing, on all property owners within 200 feet
of the premises, and notice of such hearing is published in the official Vill-age
newspaper the Thursday preceding the hearing.
The Zoning Board of Appeals only has jurisdiction over individual
cases and has not the right or privilege to change the zoning in any district,
this being a matter for. the Village Board of Trustees,in the exercise of its
legislative power after public hearing. The Zoning Board of Appeals hears,
on an average, seventy cases ayear. Minutes are kept of these hearings which
are filed with the Village Clerk and become a matter of public record.
Assisting the Zoning Board of Appeals in the clerical details of the
work are: Wilbert F. DeMott, Superintendent of Buildings and his assistant
Edmund T. Young, Russell E. Hotaling, Deputy Village Clerk and Acting Sec-retary
to the Board, and Mrs. Marge Enders, Recording Stenographer.

MORE PARK COMMISSIONERS
To make possible an enlarged Board of Park Commissioners, a public
hearing was slated for December 8th, to permit residents of the Village to par-ticipate
in a discussion as to the merits of a proposed Local Law. The park
commission, up to the present time composed of three members, has been ex-tremely
active. Looking after the affairs of the Municipal Stadium, and keep-ing
the schedule of Randall Park under close supervision, have taken a great
deal of time. Under the Chairmanship of Everett C. Fur man, the commission
came up with the park extension program, now under way, which was adopted
by the Board of Trustees. Upon resigning the Chairmanship, Mr. Furman sug-gested
that to look after the details of construction and the management of the
new parks required additional man-power. The proposed Local Law was put
before the public in response to this suggestion.

PARK PROGRAM GOES AHEAD
Work is proceeding on Freeport&#x27;s park program. On the- waterfront,
the park at the foot of Long Beach Avenue is being gradedjfill is being brought
in, and installations of permanent equipment are under way. The new Fire-men&#x27;s
Field, in the Eastern part of the Village, is being surfaced and prepared
for further development. Much work has already been done in the Northeast
Park, where basketball courts have been in operation for some time, a fence
has been completed, fireplaces built, and where substantial aid is to be given
by the County in installing a drain to control the waters of the brook that runs
through the park. By Spring the work should have been carried to such a point
that the various parks will be available for public patronage.
WHEN THE BIG WIND BLEW
The night of the big wind, November 21, caused considerable damage
and brought many discomforts over a large part of the metropolitan area. Ma-yor
Doxsee, whose experience with the sea makes him an expert at such things,
says it was not a gale,and the weather department agrees, although some gusts
reached as high as sixty five miles anhour. The wind disrupted electrical ser-vice
to some 50,000 homes — that is, in spots elsewhere -than in Freeport.
Here the windstorm brought down an estimated fifty cords of loose wood in the
shape of branches torn from trees by the breeze. The line crew of the electric
light department, under Superintendent Clinton Walling, worked on a clock-round
shift, keeping the circuits clear, sawing off dangerous and dangling branches,
and in general looking to the welfare of the public. To avoid danger, all street
lights were shut off, except along Sunrise Highway. This was done so that the
high-tension lines would not fall across the house-current lines. This might
have caused fuse blow-outs, and in extreme cases might have caused fire. In-cidentally,
the Fire Department, under Chief John Marra, kept a night-long alert.
One alarm was sounded; fortunately not for fire, but to call the firemen to come
to the aid of a householder whose roof had been torn open when a falling tree fell
upon it. The firemen stretched a tarpaulin over the hole to keep out the driving
rain.
C IVIL DEFENSE HEADQUARTERS
Your Municipal Building is now providing quarters for the Village Ci -
vil Defense Unit, of which F. Gordon Edwards (also Chairman of the Board of.&#x27;
Zoning Appeals), is the chief. The Freeport Unit responded 650 strong to the
county-wide alert drill on Wednesday evening, November 26th. County Director
Cyril C. Ryan, reported that of all the villages Freeport made the beat show-ing
on that occasion.
SIDEWALKS GET A NEW LOOK
The Board of Trustees extends its thanks to the property owners who
are co-operating to bring the sidewalks of the Village to a state of repair. In
common with other communities, many of Freeport&#x27;s sidewalks were not kept
in good condition because of the pressure brought on by war and post war short-ages
of materials and similar factors. The improvements have now been urged
by the insurance companies to reduce the liability that sometimes arises when
persons are injured because of defective conditions.. A substantial saving to
the taxpayers as well as the protection of the public it is hoped will result from
the improvements under way.
NOTE FOR JUNIOR BICYCLISTS
The coming of Fall with long hours of darkness leads the Police Chief
to ask that youngsters who ride bicycles (and their parents, too), take added
precautions. A number of close escapes from tragedy brings the suggestion
that no one should use a bicycle on the streets after dusk unless it is equipped
with a front white light, sufficiently bright to be seen for 200 feet, and a rear
red light, visible for an equal distance. Another point to keep in mind is that
bicycles should never be ridden on the Long Island Railroad platform, or on the
•walks adjacent to the depot. And as for you big fellows: Do Not ride your wheels
on any sidewalk; leave that for the little fellows.
T HE VILLAGE PLANNING BOARD
So that you may become acquainted with the work of some of our impor-tant
Village departments we invite you this month to a brief visit with our Plan-ning
Board, composed of Robert E. Patterson, Chairman, former Mayor of the
Village; Raymond Clements, importer of sports wear; Patrick Sullivan, attor-ney;
and Trustees Leonard D. B. Smith and Cord Viebrock.
The Planning Board is appointed by the Board of Trustees for a term of
three years in the following manner: Two members must be officials of the mun-icipality
(the Trustees) whose terms are concurrent with the term of the May-or.
The respective terms of the other members of this Board are for three
years.
The Planning Board has the duty of passing upon plans for the develop-ment
of the entire area of the Village or of any of its sections. This includes
recommendations for new streets, parks, roadways, sites for public buildings,
zoning districts, and similar matters concerned with the improvement of the
Village and its future growth, protection, and development.
When the Board of Trustees considers changes of any major type with-in
the Village, the first step is to refer the matter to the Planning Board for
study, report and recommendation. Once the report of the Planning Board is
received, the Board of Trustees gives it consideration, and takes such action
as seems to be in the public interest. In many instances, this will involve call-ing
a public meeting to give the public a chance to express its opinion before
taking final action.
RECODIFIED ORDINANCES
After three years of preparation, including several public hearings,
Freeport&#x27;s Unified Code of Ordinances has become effective. Reports from
the office of the State Comptroller compliment the Village authorities on hav-

ing the ordinances prepared and published, and state that it is a pattern that
should be followed by all the villages in the State. The simplified form of the
ordinances makes them readily understandable not only to attorneys but to the
average citizens to whom they apply.
The Village Clerk calls attention to the ordinances that seem particu-larly
called into use at this season of the year. They are the ordinances that
have to do with the disposal of rubbish and trash. Most residents co-operate
by helping get rid of combustible materials,by burning them on their own pre-mises.
This may be done, says Ordinance 5.5 &quot;in a screened metal container
or in an outdoor fireplace and in such a manner and under such circumstances
as not to cause unreasonable annoyance to others ... and in such manner that
no property shall be endangered.&quot; Where property owners cannot burn waste
materials, they will be collected by the Sanitation Department, but - only if
placed in metal containers or when they are compactly and securely tied, bun-dled,
or packed. There are no facilities for carting loose waste, leaves, bran-ches
or other unbundled materials. Such removals are atthe owner&#x27;s expense
and by private disposal. (See Ordianance 2. 2)
PUBLIC USES of WATER
A report recently submitted to the Board of Trustees gives some inter-esting
statistics on use of water for public purposes. Since this water comes
from Freeport&#x27;s own wells, and since the power which supplies it comes from
Freeport&#x27;s own electrical utility plant, the resultant savings to the taxpayer
are considerable. Here are the estimates of 1952 water distribution, as worked
out by the Village Comptroller, Milford F. VanRiper:
Gals. PerYr
1 - Power House, Building-Service &amp; Cooling Make -up Water 4,000,000
2 - Sewage Disposal Plant 4, 000, 000

<dc:description>POLICE BOYS&#x27; CLUB ACTIVITIES
A series of basketball games are being held by the Police Boys&#x27;
Club at Randall Park under the lights. Regular schedules of hardball, Softball,
and baseball are being run.
Every Friday, twenty boys from the Club are taken twelve miles
out for deep sea fishing, on the boats of the Viking Fleet, under the supervis-ion
of Frank Dorman and Capt. Carl Forsberg.
On August 27, the boys were scheduled for a visit to Ebbets Field,
when the Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs were playing.
LONG ISLAND RAILROAD TAXES
One effect of the Long Island Railroad&#x27;s bankruptcy has been an
accumulation of unpaid taxes over a. period of five years. In so far as these
affect the Village of Freeport, the unpaid taxes with accrued penalties total
$50,569.44. The fact that the Railroad is in bankruptcy makes full collection
doubtful, though what its capacity to pay might eventually be is a matter of spec-ulation.
The most recent move by the Railroad has been to offer the Village
$18,830.28 in settlement of all of their tax and penalty arrears. This sum is
a proportionate amount of a sum of $1,689,523.79, by which the Road offers to
settle all tax and arrearage claims in Nassau County. The offer is computed
in the same manner as the tax settlement recently entered into with the City of
New York.
Inasmuch as the offers made by the Railroad are substantially less
than the sums actually due.tlie Freeport Board of Trustees -a year ago -asked
that a combined demand be made by all Nassau County villages to hold the Rail-road
to better terms than had been offered. The suggestion was that the Nas-sau
County Village Officials A ssociation undertake to make an issue of the mat-ter,
rather than accept a lesser sum-than might actually be collectible. Re-cently,
the Village Board renewed the suggestion, and the Village Officials As-sociation
has now designated a committee, in cooperation with the County, to
go thoroughly into all matters affecting relations with the Railroad,not only as
to the unpaid taxes, but including lower fares and better train service. Mayor
William F. Glacken has been designated as one of the members of this com-mittee.
&quot;LITTER-ARY DEPARTMENT&quot;
To the Editor :
I would like to call attention of my fellow residents in Freeport, to
a condition that I think perhaps your publication may do something to clear up.
That is, in connection with a habit of some of my neighbors of using my lawn
and sidewalk as a trash basket. Within the past week, I have picked up the fol-lowing
items: discarded cigarette packages, sections of newspapers, paper
handkerchiefs (used), an empty sherry bottle in a paper bag, portion of a con-fidential
letter (unfortunately, the name was torn off).
Since I live in Residence AA district, I wonder if something cannot
be done in the way of keeping properties up to the reputation that such classifi-cation
indicates. Or do I have to be a &#x27;trash collector&#x27;for careless neighbors?
I would appreciate comment from some of your readers.

Perhaps some day a lighter weight shirt &amp; trousers will be used for the summer!1

TRIBUTE to GEORGE MAURER
The Village lost one of its best known and most active department heads
in the death of George V. Maurer, Superintendent of the Water Department, on
August 17th. Resolution of appreciation for the services he had rendered were
adopted by the Board of Trustees; and his associates in the Village, office attend-ed
the funeral services, in a body, on August 20th..
Mr. Maurer was born in 1895, at NewRochelle, New York, and was ed-ucated
in the public schools. He came to Freeport about 35 years ago, estab-lishing
himself here in the plumbing business. He served in World War I, and
upon his discharge became active in the-American Legion. In 1942 he entered
the services of the Village of Freeport, and became Superintendent of the Water
Department in 1948.
Though seriously ill, he attended a Village Board meeting to report on
the work of his department within a week of his final confinement to his home.

NEW ORDINANCES and AMENDMENTS
New ordinances - and amendments to the existing ordinances -adopted
since our last publication - are as follows :
(1) Speed limit for motor vehicles within the Village was re-enacted and max-imum
of 30 miles an hour established (except in specially marked places and
except near schools where the limit is 20 miles.) This amendment was adopt-ed
to make possible &#x27;the operation of a speed clock under control of the Police
Department.
(2) Minimum fees of $2.50 were set for the approval of plans and inspection of
plumbing fixtures, with a fee of $5.00 where fixtures numbered from three to
six, and an additional fee of $1. 00 for every fixture in the excess.
(3) Applicants for examination as licensed plumber are requiredto pay a fee of
$25.00, with $10.00 renewal fee annually.
(4) Emptying floor drains or basin sumps into sewage system is prohibited.
RAILROAD GATES DEMANDED
The Village Board presented to the Public Service Commission a de-mand
that crossing gates be installed at Brookside Avenue by the Long Island
Railroad. The demand was made at a hearing called by the Public Service Com-mission
upon the request of the Board of Trustees, on August 13th. Present
at the hearing were Mayor William F. Glacken; Village Engineer, Herbert M.
Wood; Police Chief, Peter Elar; Sup&#x27;t. of Buildings, Wilbert F. DeMott; and
Associate Chairman of the Park Commission, Van Baar Brown, who presented
the case for the Village, under questioning by Village Counsel Martin Weyrauch.
Others who testified for the Village were Robert O. Goldschmidt, representing
the Chamber of Commerce, and George Fairberg, President of the Northwest
Civic Association. Representing the P. S. C. was E. L. Bloch, hear ing examiner.
The testimony developed the grade crossing danger s created bythe
increased traffic at Brookside Avenue during the past two or three years; the
fact that a traffic signal had been placed by the State Highway Department at
Brookside Avenue and Sunrise Highway; and the use of the crossing by children
who would attend the Northwest Park, which is about to be opened.
The Long Island Railroad was represented by its General Attorney,
Henry B. Staples, who asked for further opportunity to present the Railroad&#x27;s
side of the case against the installation of gates. The hearing was setfor con-tinuance
on September 21st, 1953, for that purpose.
SPEED WATCH INSTALLED
TO: All residents of the Village of Freeport, And -
Those motorists traveling through the Village of Freeport.
The Village of Freeport, in the near future, and for the safety of the
public, will use SPEED-WATCH for the enforcement of the speed law. Cables
will be set across the roadway for a distance of 132 feet apart. These cables
will be connected to other cables leading to an electric SPEED-WATCH, which
will register the time you entered and left the zone, and the rate of speed at
which you went through the zone. At the SPEED-WATCH will be stationed a
policeman, who will stop you if you are in violation of the speed law. From then
on, the usual police procedure will take place.
Within a few days, signs reading &quot;SPEED ELECTRICALLY TIMED1
will be posted at entrances to the Village of Freeport. When you observe these
signs you can expect a SPEED-WATCH in operation at any point in the Village.
We, of the Freeport Police Department, have no desire to hold you
for speeding. All we ask is that you observe the law, thereby making Freeport
a safer place in which to live. Our speed limit is 30 miles per hour throughout
&#x27;the Village, except on school streets. The speed limit on school streets is 20
miles per hour. Let us all abide by the laws of the land and enjoy the society of
men, women and children as we should.
At Your Service,
Peter Elar, Chief of Police.

That is,our insurance rates.are notably low,because your services have

Your fellow citizens have indicated their approval of your work in
another way. They have endorsed the desire of this Board of Trustees and of
its predecessors, to see that you have the best of adequate, modern apparatus
and equipment. This for the purpose of making your work less hazardous to
you while on the job, but also as a token of appreciation for your efforts. It
lets you know that we feel you are entitled to the best from us, because you give
us the best that is in you. We are now proud to make this additional token of a
Field dedicated to Firemen, and to &#x27;Firemanics&#x27;, as an additional mark of es-teem,
and to provide you additional opportunities for training and preparation,
as well as for recreation.
My wish, that of the Village administration, and that of every res-ident
of Freeport, is that you may find in this Field the same gratification we
have always felt for your services.&quot;

and watchmen is&quot;, he said, &quot;to prevent death, and not-by inadequate systems
- to tempt death.&quot; The Village&#x27;s case was supported by a map prepared by
Village Engineer Herbert M. Wood, who from observations made in the field,
testified that the danger of the short run from Sunrise Highway to the Brook -
side Avenue crossing was an important factor in the need for additional pro-tection.
Similar protection has been ordered for the Milburn Avenue cross-ing
in Baldwin - two hundred yards away, where the Public Service Commis-sion
has instructed the Railroad to install gates. &quot;Where are the gates ?&#x27;
Counsel Weyrauch demanded of Frank Aikman, Jr. , Maintenance Engineer of
the Railroad. It then developed that, by way of compromise, a watchman is
stationed at the crossing during the &#x27;danger hours&#x27; of the day. Police Chief
Elar pointed out that Brookside Avenue was the only north-south Freeport
street unprotected by gates. He added that his police records showed that
while three deaths had occurred in five years at Brookside Avenue, no deaths
had been recorded in the same period of any of the other residential street
crossings. The Public Service Commission examiner, E. L. Block, withheld
decision.
ZONING BOARD NEWS

DISPOSAL OF RUBBISH AND LEAVES
The Fall season brings with it the usual problem of how to dispose of
fallenleaves and other rubbish. The answers to questions which property own-ers
ask most frequently are provided in three&#x27;Village ordinances. The first,
in Chapter 2, &quot;Health and Sanitation&quot;, is Ordinance 2.2, which places upon the
householders the duty of keeping properties clear of accumulations of waste
and rubbish, which maybe placed in metal containers for collection by the Vil-lage.
Combustible and non-combustible material must be kept in separate
containers. Except for garbage, incombustible materials may be prepared for
collection, by tying them in packages or bundles of no more than fifty pounds
each. .These maybe.placed alongside the refuse containers and will be picked
up in regular routine by the Sanitation Department collectors.
In C hapter 5, concerned with fire control and prevention, provisions are
set for the disposal of rubbish by burning it on one&#x27;s own premises outdoors.
Fires for such purposes are permitted only &quot;in a screened metal receptacle,
or in an outdoor fireplace, and in such manner and under such circumstances
as not to cause un-reasonable annoyance to others through the spreading of
smoke and ashes, and in such manner that no property shall be endangered.&quot;
For those who find it more convenient to burn accumulated leaves, pa-per
and other materials in the street. Ordinance # 7.4, of the chapter dealing
with streets and sidewalks must be observed - that is, &quot;no fire shall be made
within fiftyfeet of any building unless the material to be burnt is &quot;contained in
a receptacle constructed of iron or wire and completely covered with an iron
or wire top, so closely woven as to prevent the flying of ashes therefrom.&quot;
BROOKSIDE AVENUE CROSSING
In its effort to induce the Public Service Commission to order the Long
Island RailRoad to establish gates and watchman service at the Brookside Av-enue
crossing, Mayor G lacken accompanied by members of the Village Admin-istrative
staff, attended a session of the Commission on Monday, September 2 1,
at which the Railroad introduced testimony purporting to show that further pro-tections
were an unnecessary and costly expense. Much of the Railroad&#x27;s ev-idence
was basedupon figures showing that there had been relatively few deaths
at the crossing. The Village figures actually showed that three persons had
died there within recentyears and that the hazards were increased many times
by increased population and by the establishment nearby of the Northwest Park.
Village Counsel, Martin Weyrauch, who conducted the Village&#x27;s case, demand-ed
of the Railroad representatives if it was their philosophy that grade cross-ings
only needed to be protected after many deaths had occurred there. He
said that the point the Village was insisting upon was that protection should be

MILL ROAD TO BE WIDENED
In conformity with a plan approved by the Village Board, properties
along Mill Road have been acquired by Nassau County as the first physical step
in the project to widen Mill Road. The property was acquired in condemnation
proceedings held at the Nassau County Court House in Mineola, on September
15th. The County, by this transfer, acquired title for easements which will
&#x27;make possible a re-alignment as well as widening of Mill Road, fron Nassau
Road (South Main Street) to Merrick Road.
ORDINANCES AMENDED
By action of the Board of Trustees, Ordinance 7.101 was amended to
reduce the fee for permits to make repairs to existing sidewalks from $5. to
$2. Permits for the construction of new sidewalks remain at $5.
To clarify the regulations regarding the minimum first floor grades as
required in the construction of buildings in areas fronting on navigable waters,
and to key the ordinance to the Village vertical control map, an amendment was
adopted to Sec. 405 of the Building Code, Ordinance No. 9. 1.
WRITTEN NOTICE REQUIRED In DAMAGE SUITS
After a public hearing on Sept. 28th, the Village Board adopted as Local
• Law No. 1, 1953, an amendment to Section 341 a of the Village Law, providing
for written notice of defective, unsafe, dangerous, obstructed condition of a
street, highway, bridge, culvert, curb, sidewalk or crosswalk prior to the
maintenance of a civilaction againstthe Village for damages or injuries to per-son
or property.

ACCENT ON YOUTH
&quot;What Freeport Has to Offer Toward the Development of Its Youth&quot;, was
the title of an address delivered by Mayor William F. Glacken, on Tuesday,
Sept. 17th, to the members of the Archer Street Parent-Teachers Association
in the school auditorium.
The Mayor stressed the need of a park and playground program and em-phasized
the benefits derived from such a well-rounded all year program. He
mentioned that Mr. Joseph Caverly had been employed by the Village of Free-port
as its Recreational Director, who would co-ordinate all activities carried
on within the Village, especially for children and teen-agers. Heretofore, no
organized activities have been carried on for the girls of the community, and
the Mayor, felt that this need would be now adequately taken care of. The pro-gram
of the Recreational Director will in no way conflict with the Police Boys
Club activities, under the direction of Patrolman Joseph Romeika. Said ac-tivities
will be merely a segment of the over-all recreational program.
The Mayor pointed out that from the standpoint of facilities the program
was an assured success, as the Board of Education has heartily endorsed the
program and has made available indoor facilities for the winter and inclement
weather. These&#x27;facilities, in addition to those now under construction in the
Northwest Park, Waterfront Park, and additional facilities for the already ded-icated
N ortheastPark, will give Freeport the finest set of parks and playgrounds
on Long Island.
Mayor Glacken said the Administration was deeply concerned with the
welfare of the children, and during the past year has employed Special School
Crossing Policemen for the most dangerous crossings; thereby not weakening
.the .regular Police Force. He also related of the strong fight being waged be-fore
the Public Service Commission by Village Counsel, Martin Weyrauch,
over the unprotected Brookside Avenue Crossing. Efforts to reduce speeding
within the residential areas have been supplemented by the Village, by the pur-chase
and employment of a new Electrical Speed Timing Device.
BOUQUET FOR THE FREEPORT FIRE DEPARTMENT
To the Freeport Fire Department:
Several weeks ago you were called upon to put out a fire in our refriger-ator.
I just wanted you to know how grateful I am for your efficiency, courtesy
and thoughtfulness;up until then I had never heard of firemen going out of their
way to avoid damaging one&#x27;s floor with water. I I can&#x27;t tell you how much I ap -
preciate it, and I have been singing your praises ever since.
Mrs. Wm. Hodgkinson.
NOTICE
We are including this extra insert in the regular Bulletin, because of the tragedy
very pertinent to the &quot;Brookside Avenue Crossing&quot; case, which occurred after
the Bulletin&#x27;s completion.
Gates Demanded For Brookside Crossing^
Two deaths and critical injuries to a third victim on September 30 brought
immediate further action by the Board of Trustees to secure added protection
at the Brookside Avenue railroad crossing. The accident followed a hearing on
September 21, at which the unwillingness of the railroad to provide protective
gates was sharply criticized by Mayor Glacken and other Village representatives.
&quot;It seems that the railroad only wants to install gates after someone has been
killed&quot;, Village C ounsel Weyrauch said. The following telegram was sent to the
Public Service Commission after the fatal accident of September 30:
&quot;Two persons were killed at 9:18 lastnight when a motor vehicle ran onto
Long Island Railroad track at imperfectly protected Brookside Avenue crossing
Freeport. A third victim is inSouthNassauCommunityHospital in critical con-dition
as this is being written. This ghastly confirmation of statements made
at Public Service Commission hearings by me and other witnesses for the Vil-lage
of Freeport emphasizes the need of immediate action to minimize dangers
to prevent further deaths and injuries in this populous community with trains
running at the high frequency of Long Island Railroad schedules.
&quot;If further evidence is required we ask immediate reopening of hearings
officially closed by Examiner Block. We suggest, however, that this accident
fully confirms evidence already on record before you, that pending installation
of the overhead grade crossing elimination, barrier gates with flashing lights
and bell be erected to prevent tragedies of this nature, and that&#x27;such order be
directed forthwith to the Long Island Railroad, to bring the present heartless
situation under control.
&quot;We insist, further, that until such installation is accomplished, a 24-hour
watchman service be established. The very sort of conditions as pointed out by
Counsel for the Village, led to the very sort of accident these intolerable con-ditions
invite. Until these conditions are removed by grade elimination, more
perfect safeguards are imperatively needed. &quot;

<dc:description>PEDESTRIANS -With more hours of darkness, increased attention must be given
whenever and wherever you cross streets, with special attention in crossing the

ability to see you decreases.in foggy and rainy weather, and increases your need
for using more care in crossing streets. Wear something white at night !

FROM OUR MAILBOX
To the Editor:
I was indeed pleased to read the article &#x27;Litter-ary.Department1 -in your
September issue. • I have had the same experience (in picking up discarded pa-pers
and other refuse) as &quot;A Citizen&quot; has Had. Being a trash&quot; collector is some
thing I had not bargained for .when I moved to Freeport . . . . . I think something
should be done to.combat the thoughtless habit of discarding;trash from moving
•cars and by-pedestrians. Also, dogs should be walked and curbed and not-per-mitted
to run free. I suggest a concerted effort by the police, civic associations
the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, to educate our residents for
a cleaner and more beautiful Freeport. Much can be done by parents to keep the
children from thoughtless thro wing around of discarded ice-cream-pop wrappers
and other such refuse.
Freeport stands to gain- immeasurably .if we stop the &#x27;litter-bug&#x27; now !

BUCKET BRIGADE for KOREAN CLOTHES
So generous was the response of Freeport-to&#x27;the plea for contributions of
clothing for Korean relief that the storage room at the Salvation Army headquar-ters
on Church Street was filled to overflowing.- • A moving van came on, Sunday
morning, October 25th, to start the articles on-their-way, but no one had been as-signed
to carry the packages from the building to the truck. An appeal for help
brought Mayor Glacken and Trustee Seward Baker to the scene. The problem in-volved
the transfer of several tons.of assorted wearing-apparel packed in card -
board containers... Mayor Glacken communicated with John Capa^olli, Incinera-tor
foreman, who gathered a group of Village employees and brought them to the
building. Trustee Baker enlisted the aid of twenty firemen from the Truck Com-pany
across the street, A &#x27;bucket brigade&#x27; line was formed, the goods were passed
from the Salvation Army rooms to the truck, and the clothing was started for Korea.
LETTER OF APPRECIATION
Gentlemen: .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, and the members of the
Freeport Fire Department for the very excellent job done in protecting our tele-phone
cables during the recent fire in Albert&#x27;s Store on Main Street.
Cooperating with Fire Chief A. Benson of the Roosevelt Fire Department,
a Telephone Company employee, your boys did an admirable job in keeping the fire
damage to a minimum.
Very truly yours.

Vol. 2 - No. 11 November 1953
&#x27; FREEPORT FIGHTS A FIRE
One of the largestfires inFreeport in many years destroyed six storage
sheds of the C. Milton Foreman Lumber Yards, located between MainStreet and
Henry Street, and between the Long Island Railroad tracks and Broadway. The
$75,000 blaze, touched off Saturday, October 17th, by two boys spread rapidly
and with such intensity that buildings hundreds of feet distant were scorchedand
seared by the heat, and nearly 2, 000 feet of fire hose were charred and burst.
To&#x27;make up&quot; the deficiency, the Village Board,&#x27;as an emergency measure, or-dered
Fire Chief Franklyn Grernpel to provide replacements, assuring all com-panies
of an adequate&#x27;supply. &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;
All departments&#x27;of the Village were co-ordinated to meet the emergency.
Every piece of apparatus and full complements of fire-fighters were directed by
Chief Grempel and his assistants. They were all needed to prevent the spread
of the flames into the Main Street area. Police controls were under direction
of Cap. Edward Dixon. Clinton Walling, Superintendent of Power Distribution,
and his entire force were at the scene. There were ten major breaks in power
lines caused by the blaze, all of -which were immediately repaired, and current
diverted through emergency lines to&#x27;prevent interruption of normal activities.
Bernard Larkin, Acting Superintendent of Water Supply, was present, and di-rected
operation of the Village&#x27;s&#x27;big pumps so&#x27;as to keep adequate pressures of
water available for the fire-fighters. Much assistance was rendered too, by the
Superintendent of-Highways, H arry Chuisano,&quot;and members of the Highway De-partment,
clearing way for the apparatus by using bulldozers-to push aside the
rubbish and opening ways for the laying of hose, and use of other fire-fighting
equipment. Trustee Leonard D. B. Smith, donned in fire-fighting garments as
official representative of the Village Board, directed the co-ordination of the
various Village departments.
The Board of Trustees has adopted resolutions praising the fine work of
&#x27;the Freeport Fire Department, It has also forwarded to the fire departments of
Oceanside, Rqosevelt, and Merrick, appreciation of their neighborly service in
sending apparatus to Freeport firehouses left vacant because of the emergency,
and &#x27;standing by&#x27; to answer other alarms, should any come in.
GRADE CROSSING INFORMATION
Following hearings before the Public Service Commission, a watchman
has been put on duty by the Long Island Railroad, upon orders of the Public Ser-vice
Commission, at the Milburn Avenue grade crossing. This temporary ser-vice
will be supplemented next spring by the installation of safety barrier gates.
Meanwhile, to provide this and other crossings in Freeport with complete pro-
&#x27; tection, the Public Service Commission has forwarded to the Village its general
plans for grade crossing elimination, for examination and comment. The plans
were studied by Village Engineer Herbert Wood. He reported to the Mayor that
they are substantially satisfactory, but recommended certain changes in detail
to conform with the plans as ordered by the Public Service Commission after the
full hearing conducted by the Village in 1949-1950. The engineer&#x27;s recommen-dations
.were forwarded to the Commission by Mayor Glacken^ with a suggestion
that the final plans be prepared, and work begun at an early date. The Mayor,
upon motion of the Board, also stated that the Village- would: want an escalator
as part of the final plans, and asked for its inclusion in the plans.
: Delay in construction .of the. Freeport-Baldwin grade elimination as ap-proved
by the P.S.C. is due to a depletion of the $300,000.000 fund originally
provided by a State bond issue to finance such projects, and failure by the Leg-islature
at its 1952-1953 session to provide the $6. 000,000 to $8,000,000 nec-essary
to finance this project. As the law now stands, the expense of elimina-tion
projects are paid in the first instance by the State, later to be repaid by the
railroad company, exclusive of the cost of railroad and incidental improvements.
With the cooperation of officials in county and state governments, it is hoped that
the necessary funds will be provided at the coming legislative session.
NEW ENGINE NOW in LINE at POWER PLANT
.The new 4350 H. P.. Lima-Hamilton diesel engine, with its full comple-ment
of electricity-producing adjuncts, is fully installed and is bearing its share
of producing: current at the Freeport Municipal Electric Power Plant, under the
supervision of Superintendent Wm. Tompkins. The new machinery is rated at
a capacity of 3100 kilowatts. The engine was purchased and installed at a.cost
of approximately $350,000. With the necessary additions to the Power Plant,
auxiliary apparatus and switch gear, the cost totalled approximately $800, 000.
payment of which is provided under a- bond issue, which.will be paid out of the
earnings of the Plant. It is anticipated that use of the new engine will bring a-bout
a considerable savings in operation^ since it is designed to use low-grade
relatively inexpensive oil as fuel.
ANNUAL FIRE INSPECTION
The annual inspection of the Freeport Fire Department, and a check of
fire apparatus was held by the Village Board on Sunday, October 25th. Present
at the inspection were Mayor Glacken, Trustees Leonard D. B. Smith. Cord Vie-brock,
Seward Baker and Edward.Cheshire, and Village Counsel Martin Wey -
rauch. The inspection, because of inclement weather, was held at Fire Head-quarters
on North Main Street, followed by visits to the various fire houses. Af-ter
the inspection tour firemen and Village Board members attended the annual
memorial services at the Episcopal Church of the Transfiguration, where a ser-mon
in tribute to deceased members of the department was preached by the Rev,
erend Reginald Scott, chaplain. Mayor Glacken, on behalf of the Board, com-plimented
the members of the department and their officers for their patriotic
services, the efficient conduct of the department, and the fine appearance of its
apparatus and buildings.
BUILDING DEPT. REPORT
The following permits were issued in the Building Department, for the
month of September, 1953:
59 Permits for new construction . Cost $559,400.
12 Permits for additions &amp; alterations Cost . 9,265.
Total $568,665.
GARDEN-TYPE BUSINESS ZONE
The Village Board, for some time, has had under consideration an a-mendment
to the Zoning Law providing for an exclusive or &#x27;garden type* busi-ness
zone, with restrictions so rigid as to prevent undesirable or unsightly es-tablishments.
One hearing has already been held, but to give full opportunity
for expressions of opinion on the subject a second hearing has been set to be held
November 23rd, 1953. The following types of retail business would be pe.rmit-
. ted: dry goods and dress shops, food1 and -drug stores, stationery, book, gift,
craft,-house hold electrical appliances, air conditioning, heating and plumbing,
hardware; confections, photographer, household furnishings, toys, draperies,
jewelry; restaurants, and other similar places of business. Food retail shops
would be limited to a 3,000 square foot area. Storage garages, garage repair
shops, filling stations, poultry and pet shops, coal and lumber establishments
and similar enterprises would be prohibited. For a full expression of public
opinion, the Board invites residents to attend this and other public hearings at
which changes in the zoning ordinance and other ordinances are open for public
discussion. Since this Municipal Bulletin is published n» oftencr than once a
month, it is not possible to advertise in it the public hearings to be held. The
law requires all such notices to be published at least ten days in advance of each
meeting in the official newspaper of the Village. That newspaper is the Freeport
Leader.. All residents interested in public affairs are urged to follow the noti-ces,
and to attend the hearings so that the fullest discussion may be had, for the
benefit, of the Board in determining its course of action.
EARLY MORNING MAIL COLLECTION
Postmaster RalphL. Marshal] announces that on October 19th, the Free-port
Post Office placed in effect-ah early morning collection service from all
street letter boxes. This will replace the collection made between 9:00 and 10:00
A.M. for the more expeditious dispatch of letters mailed after the evening col-lection.
Dispatch is on the train leaving Freeport at 9:00 A. M. , instead of on
the 1:00 P.M.train formerly used. Also,letters addressed for delivery in Free -
port and mailed after the evening collection will be delivered the following day.
The early morning collection had been in effect prior to the curtailment
of certain services for economy reasons in 1950. It was reinstated at the Post-master&#x27;s
request after a survey by the local post office supervisory, staff*. Post
Office Department approval was forthcoming when it was. shown that no additional
expense would be involved.
HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT ACTIVITIES
Although delayed on some of its major projects by the truckmen&#x27;s strike
in New York City, which held up deliveries of road building materials, the High-way
Department under direction of Superintendent Harry Chuisano, this summer
completed work on the following projects: surfaced the Grove Street parking
field, surfaced the parking field adjacent to Hose Company #3, Bay view A venue,
constructed a roadway for Firemen&#x27;s Memorial Field, filled in several aban-doned
cellar holes, resurfaced and repaired 23 miles of Village streets, con-structed
11/2 miles of new drains, cleaned obstructions from 4miles of drains.
In addition,the department has begun work on the traffic intersection at Bay view
Avenue and Ray Street. It has also graded part of the area surrounding Milburn
Pond, and removed the undergrowth, in response to an appeal of the Southwest
Civic Association, presented at a Board meeting, by President Harry McCarthy
This improvement was one of the activities scheduled by the Park Commission,
but temporarily delayed. At a later date, the detailed items of an extensive
park -development will be carried out.
NOTICE
This extra insert is being included with the regular Bulletin as a special appeal
for more Civil Defense volunteers, who are needed in order to bring all services up to
full strength.
Civil Defense - as organized under the existing law .- is a means by which a
community can help itself in case of disaster due to enemy attack. Long range air craft
are now ready and capable of delivering frightful bombing weapons. No one knows what
will arise from the present disturbed state of world conditions; however, advance pre-paration
for all possible developments seems wise. The responsibility for handling em-ergency
situations due to enemy attack has been placed on the Civil Defense Organization.
Civil Defense has many services in which both men and women can be used. Little
or no training is required for some services; somewhat greater training is needed for
others, although none of the time required would be excessive. If emergency conditions
arise, however, no time would be available for training, and the value of Civil Defense
• &#x27; &quot; • * &#x27; • &#x27; • &#x27;
would therefore be impaired when most needed; , . ^. &#x27; &#x27; • i
There is a place for everyone - men, women, and bpys and girls (over 14 years
of age) - in the various Civil Defense Services, but particularly in Medical, Wardens, Wel-fare,
Rescue and Air Craft Warning (Sky Watch) f Your help.is needed in this worthwhile
community effort organized for your own benefit and protection. Let us hope we will never
require its use, but at least let us be ready if need be.
Please, therefore,, fill in the enclosed addressed card and return; no postage is
required. Present Civil Defense personnel need not return the card.

MAYOR SPEAKS AT ARMISTICE DAY EXERCISES
Mayor William F. Glacken delivered the address of the day at the Arm-istice
Day exercises,November 11, at the Municipal Stadium,, In part,, Mayor
Glacken saids
&quot;On thio Armistice Day,, let us resolve to be more than ever firmly un-ited
as we continue the battle, that has been forced upon uo by an implacable
foe, knowing of the perils that we face, but enlisted for a common good of all
humanity. We muot win this battle; we must win itto preserve the institutions
that we hold dear. We must win it that slavery is not enforced the whole world
around.&quot;
&quot;As veterans united in this common cause, I ask that we all ask that to-night,

FLOOD, WIND AND MILK STRIKE
All departments of the Village were alerted to meet two emergencies dur-ing
November. When a strike of milk wagon drivers cut off the supplies in
the village. Mayor Glacken, Trustee Viebrock, Fire Chief Grempel and other
officials provided a set-up that would have made milk available to allcomers
at the Freeport fire houses. The arrangements were cleared with union of-ficials,
the fire department was ready to act a o retail selling agency, when the
strike was called off, and the normal routine of deliveries was re-established.
The high tide, pushed inshore by heavy winds created a more serious condi-tion.
Many homes in the low-lying southern part of the village were maroon-ed,
and relied upon the fire department, the local officials of the Salvation
Army, veterans organizations, civil defense units and volunteers both in the
village service and from the civilian population for rescue and relief. Many
of the village officials were in the frontline, directing operations. Of the
many letters of gratitude which have been received, the two following are ex-amples:
Dear Mayor Glacken: May we extend our sincere thanks for the swiftness
with which the Village power plant and line department had our lights repair-ed,
after the damage done by the high tide and wind, which broke down the
lines. To ba without light and heat is exceedingly trying when you have three
boys in bed, with fevers, and other invalid in the house. Very understanding
of the extreme hardship of others in this emergency was the solicitude shown
by the workers from the V illage who made the repairs. We appreciate the re-turn
of the power upon which all of us seem to lean so heavily in this mechan-ized
era. Bernie Kalban,
340 Souths ide Ave.
Dear Judge Kelly: The William Clinton Story Post, No. 342 wish to express
our deep appreciation of your kind efforts to us in securing blankets for dis-tribution
to distressed people in the emergency created bythe recent terrific
otorm. Your efficient and speedy co-operation was most generous and is sin-cerely
appreciated. Yours for the good of the community, Russ Redfield.

SIDEWALK REPAIR PROGRAM
To reduce as much as possible the losses caused by bad sidewalk condi-tions
the Village instituted a repair program early in the summer,which with
the approach of winter weather has gone into slower motion. Raymond Kiernan,
assigned to inspect and report on dangerous conditions throughout the Village
has made numerous recommendations to the Board, and has reported practi-
cally unanimous cooperation on the part of property owners.
Approximately 550 our veys have been made since adoption of the program
and 450 to 475 projects have been completed, almoot entirely byths property
owners themselves. There have been only fifteen instances where the village
has been obliged to have the work done and the cocl assessed against the pro-perty.
The cost of these various sidewalk repairs or installation of new aide-walk,,
where none existed, has ranged from $60.00 to higher brackets, with
an approximate average cost of $150.00. In addition to this, the Village hao
also made repairs in a number of cases where sidewalk and curb defects were
due to Village activities.
It is requested that property owners throughout the Village inspect their
sidewalks for possible defects and arrange to have them repaired without wait-ing
for an official notice from the Village.

POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE OPEN LABORATORY IN FREEPORT
f
The Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, one of the largest engineering
schools in the country, has had under construction for the past 15 months a
new Aerodynamics Laboratory at 527 Atlantic Avenue, Freeport. About to
go into operation at this laboratory are two supersonic wind tunnels capable
of developing speeds five time that of sound. .These tunnels are of the inter-mittent
typef running fo r approximately one minute several times a day. They
operate from air stored in air flasks behind the main building and compressed
by four electric driven compressors.
These tunnels and the building have been financed by the Polytechnic
Institute of Brooklyn. Considerable equipment for the machine shop has been
obtained from government surplus through the Office of NavalResearch of the
department of the Navy. The facility will be used on government sponsored
research projects, either by direct contract with the Armed Forces or by sub-contract
with the local aircraft and engine manufacturers. No classes will be
conducted at the laboratory for the time being. A staff of approximately fif-teen
faculty members and research workers and nine machinists and techni-cians
will be employed full time on these projects. Presently being designed
and prepared for final installation sometime in 1954, is hypersonic wind tun-nel
being constructed for the Department of the Air Force. .This tunnel will
be of an advanced design and will be capable of simulating test conditions at
speeds greater than ten times the speed of sound.
Special provisions for the supplying of electric current for the labora-tory
have been made in cooperation with the Freeport Municipal Electric util-ities
under the supervision of Clinton H. W ailing, Supt. Electrical distribution.
WORK ON FIREMEN&#x27;S FIELD
Various departments of the Village with specific emphasis on the Fire
Department have contributed to the grading and filling of the area south of Sun-rise
Highway and west side of Buffalo Avenue, where work is in progress for

Board that existing grades of the baseball area have been checked and it was
found that sufficient fill material is in place to grade the entire section so that
top soil may be placed and the field ready for use this coming summer. Con-tracts
for additional fill have been advertised so that the entire field may be
made ready for use at an early date.

in figures $ 920, 186. 98 had been collected out of a total levy of $983, 594. 61.
The principal deficiency is due to the failure of the Long Island Railroad to pay
$10,459.59 assessed against it. Final settlement of the L. I.R. R. Taxes is de-layed
due to the fact that railroad affairs are under the supervision of the Fed-eral
Bankruptcy Court.
RESCUED FROM THE SNOW
&quot;Dear Mayor Glacken:
Last night our car was stuck in the snow on Merrick Road and we
were unable to get out of the drift. A s it was after midnight there was not much
traffic on the road. (We were returning from a fraternal organization meeting
and were in formal clothes.) The officer in your Police radio Car #1 gave us
every assistance possible and when he could not help us out of our difficulty
sent a wrecker to our assistance. I think this officer is to be commended for
his courtesy and his ready willingness to be of help. I feel he went out of his
way to help us.
(Signed) Mildred J. Blacker&quot;

REVERAND REGINALD HEBER SCOTT
We are proud to write about an individual who is truly a great humani-tarian
and whose love of people has brought him close to those of all walks of
life. Freeport can be proud that it was our Village he came to forty years ago
to become Rector of the Episcopal Church of the Transfiguration.
&quot;Doc&quot; Scott as he is so fondly called, will celebrate this year fiftyyears
in the priesthood of his church, born in C anada a son of a Minister and a Grand-son
of a Minister, named after the Bishop Reginald Heber of India, author of
the famous hymn, &quot;From Greenlands Icy Mountains&quot; - Studied in and graduated
from Berkeley Divinity School, New Haven, Conn. .Received his Bachelor of
Divinity degree and continued his studies at Trinity College, Hartfort, Conn. ,

While Rector of a growing parish, with its many duties he still found time
to aid in the founding of the Freeport Memorial Library and was appointed
Trustee in 1925 and in the year of 1937 became President, continuing actively
in this capacity to date.
He has been Chaplain for thirty years of the Freeport Volunteer Fire
Department and the rank and file of its member s have truly taken him into their
hearts. Spartan Lodge, of the Masons also claim him as their Chaplain for
some thirty years.

fields within the next few months. The first field will be on South Ocean Ave.
immediately south of Sunrise Highway; the second field will be in the vicin-ity
of the contemplated Railroad Station Plaza on Henry Street.
The Mayor in his talk outlined a twelve-point program for the 1954 im-provements,
including the expansions of the park and playground program,
an effort to bring about the railroad grade crossing elimination, expansion
of municipal facilities and the creation of a traffic bureau within the Police
Department.
RELIEF ASKED FOR TAXPAYERS
An article by Village Counsel Martin H. Weyrauch, has won honorable
mention in the Law Review of the National Institute of Municipal LawOfficers.
This publication is made up of materials supplied by corporation counsels of
cities and villages throughout the Country. The article proposed that steps be
taken to protect cities and villages from the excessive costs of settling claims
in negligence actions. It pointedout that juriesof the present day make awards
to individual claimants that run over a quarter of a million dollars each and
•that several claims of such nature might well impose an intolerable burden
upon the taxpayers of a community in which the accident brought on by munici-pal
negligence might occur.
The article suggests that limitations upon such recoveries be imposed so
as not to let the burden of taxation fall to heavily upon a limited group of tax-payers.
This matter has been brought to the attention of the State Legislature
by action of the New York State Conference of Mayors and reforms in the pre-sent
law to provide protection to the taxpayers are being urged as a result.
Assemblyman John Burns has been active in this Campaign.
BOARD MEETING
It was decided by the Board of Trustees
of the Village to omit the regular meeting
scheduled for FEBRUARY 22nd, 1954, due
to that date being a HOLIDAY.
EDWARDS ARRIVES IN INDONESIA
Friends of F. Gordon Edwards have received letters indicating his safe
arrival in the City of Djakara, Java, where he is located at the Hotel Des
Indes. Mr. Edwards, who was director of the Freeport Civil Defense and
Chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals, has been assigned to make a sur-vey
of the telephone lines and needs for expansion throughout Indonesia, as
part of an engineering survey to modernize all sorts of equipment and facili-ties
in that Island Republic.
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS VOTERS HAVE DISAPPROVED
In checking over old Village records, John DeLorme, former Village
Trustee, found the following interesting data as to propositions for public im-provements
rejected by the Village of Freeport between the years 1896 and
1927. Votes were taken on these propositions under a provision of the Vil-lage
Law which Vested voters with authority under mandatory referenda to
determine what should be done in various situations. The law was revised
in 1927 to permit public improvements under permissive referendums. The
following propositions were rejected under the old Law;
1896 Rejected $400 for the erection of a fire house on Bayview Ave.
for Hose Company #3.
Rejected $150 for maintenance of the Board of Health.
1898 Rejected $500 for maintenance of Police Department.
Rejected $150 for maintenance of Board of Health.

Fulton St.

Village, 242 to 114.

Bayview Avenue, from Merrick Road to Atlantic Ave.

in the amount of $309, 924. 00 in the Village during 1953. Details of the
report prepared by John J. McDonald, Fire Department Statistician, show that
the department was called out to respond to 321 alarms; 237 of the alarms
came in over the telephone lines to police headquarters, while 68 were from
alarm boxes; 16 by radio--148 alarms were for grass fires; 49 for fires in
private homes; 38 for fires in automobiles; 16 in commercial buildings; 4 in
apartment houses; 4 in private garages, 5 in boats, and the remainder, miscellan-ous.
The First Aid Department was called out six times to five emergency treaty

The main cause of fires was due to defective electrical wiring, unex-tinguished
cigarettes, defective flues, oil stoves and spontaneous combustion
caused by ignition of rubbish. The greatest number of fires were in October
when the department answered 21 calls and the least number in July when there
were only two. The greatest number of fires averaging 38 by days, occurred
on Saturdays; with the lowest average of 14occurringon Thursdays.

PROPOSED NEW HOSPITAL IN FREEPORT
The Doctors&#x27; General Hospital will have a corner-stone laying on March
21st at 2:30 P. M. The actual ground-breaking and construction work will
commence on Monday, March 1st, onMerrickRoad, between Bayview and Wash-ington

and will provide employment for one hundred people. A Corner-stone
laying program is being mapped out and the large Fire Department and High
School bands will play; it will be more or less a community program, with re-presentatives
of all Civic Associations invited.
ZONING CHANGE
The Village Board after a hearing attended by a large number of people,
changed the zoning of the area immediately to the west of the Freeport Library
on Merrick Road, to the newly formed Business &quot;AA&quot; district. The Board
was complimented for its action by the Northeast Civic Association, in letter
which follows:
Dear Mayor Glacken:
The Board of Directors of the Northeast Civic Association met
on February 2nd, and discussed a mong other things the possibility of rezoning
the necessary area on MerrickRoad which would permit the C.I. T. Corpora-tion
to build a building in Freeport.
It was unanimously agreed that this rezoning would meet with
favor in the Association. We believe this is the type of business which can be
equally beneficial to Freeport and itself.
Northeast Civic Association
J.H. Morrow, Secretary
Negotiations for the use of&#x27;property in this vicinity for a modern bus-iness
establishment have been conducted by the C.I. T. Corporation, which is
a country wide organization and is a 90 million dollar corporation.
It has one other office located on Long Island in Manhasset and is the
largest finance company for the financing of automobiles in the country. The
plans proposed call for a garden type structure with setback and ornamental
shrubbery based upon modern concepts of business building construction.

SPEEDERS DETERRED BY SPEED-WATCH
A Speed-Watch was put into operation in Freeport on July 28, 1953.
This device consists of hollow rubber tubes stretched parallel across the road-way,
132 feet apart. At the curb end of each of these tubes a switch is attached
which leads to the Speed-Watch by electrical cables located several hundred
feet away. This in turn is connected to an electrical watch that records the
speed. As a vehicle passes over the first tube pressure of the motor vehicle
activates the mercury switch and starts the Speed-Watch in operation. As a ve-hicle
runs across the second tube the switch stops the clock and the speed of the
vehicle is registered thereon. If the motorist has exceeded the speed limit
of the Village of Freeport, &quot;which is 30 miles per hour, he is stopped and a
summons is issued. The object of the Speed-Watch is to reduce speeding on
the highways in order to obtain a desired result, to wit: lesser accidents and
lesser fatal results therefrom.
Police Chief Elar reports that to date some 94 summonses have been
issued for speeding checked by this Speed-Watch. The system, he states,
tends to prove that the Speed-Watch has been a deterrent to speeding on our
Village Highways and has become a necessary part in our program to reduce
speed and promote safety.

H ISTORICAL BUILDING TORN DOWN
Supt. of Buildings. Wilbert F. DeMott, has granted permit for the demoli-tion
of the so-called &quot;historical building&quot; or old Raynor house, known as 218
So. Main Street. The building was erected in 1783 and the property was ac-quired
in 1942 on .behalf of the Freeport Historical Society by its president,
the late Justice Hilbert R. Johnson. The original intention was to convert it
to a museum for the preservation of historical objects. The plan was not car-ried
out due to difficulties created by the war and damaged caused to it by the
hurricane in 1 947, and the building fell in such ruin as to be incapable of re —
construction.
BEAUTIFICATION COMMITTEE
The newly appointed Beautification Committee under the Chairmanship of
Dr. M. G. Isenberg, has sugge sted to the Board of Trustees that the Village
adopt the Dagwood tree as the best type of tree to be planted generally through-out
the Village, especially as replacement along the curbs and sidewalks. One
of the Village&#x27;s primary difficulties has arisen from the fact that the swamp
maples which were generally planted th roughout the Village some 30 or 40years
ago create havoc with the side-walks. Therefore, as rapidly as trees of this
type are takenout, it is considered desirable to replace them with trees of less
destructive character. On the Committee with Dr. Isenberg are Maurice Dick
and Mrs. Maude Friedman,
DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME
The Board of Trustees has adopted a resolution making Daylight Saving
Time effective in Freeport fr om 2:00 A. M. on April 25, 1954 to September 26,
1954 at 2:00 A. M. This parallels daylight saving time throughout the State.
LACROSSE INTER CQLLEGIATE GAME
The North-South LaCrosse Inter Collegiate game to be held at the Free-port
MuniciPal Stadium on Friday night, June llth( will be the biggest colleg-iate
athletic event ever held on Long Island. The Players on these two teams
of the United States Inter Collegiate LaCrosse Association are seniors and will
be drawn from 38 colleges extending all the way from Dartmouth at Hanover,
N.H. , down to Chapel Hill University of North Carolina, and as far west as
Ohio State University.
The game will probably be preceded by an All Star High School game.
College LaCrosse coaches have hailed the fact that the game is moving to Long
island, which is rapidly becoming known as the eastern LaCrosse center. Local
Colleges now playing LaCrosse are Hofstra and Adelphi, also about lOhigh
schools. Mr. Howdy Myers, Jr. , resident of Freeport, the LaCrosse coach
at Hofstra, is to be Director of the game.

In looking through Village records, Mr. John DeLorme, ran across a
clipping from a newspaper of August 27, 1853 which goes into detail of the
origin of the name of the Village of Freeport.
NOTICE - At a meeting of the inhabitants of Raynortown, held pursuant
to notice, Aug. 6, 1853, to consider the propriety of changing the name of that
place, Willet Charlick was chosen Chairman and A. L. Foote, Secretary.
On the motion being put, a majority of six were infavor of theoldname,
Raynortown. The vote stood 17 for Raynortown and 11 for Bayside Village
On the 13th of August, another meeting was held upon the same subject,
the minority being dissatisfied with the decision of the first meeting, when on
putting the vote, the same result was obtained; viz: 30 votes were given to re-tain
the name of Raynortown and 23 for Freeport.

&quot;Speed Kills, take it easy!&quot; - This warning was issued today by Chief
Peter Elar.who stressed the need for speed control as a curb on traffic acci-dents.
Chief .Elar spoke on behalf of the speed control program the Freeport
Police Department is conducting this month in cooperation with the National
Safety Council.
&quot;More than 25 percent of the drivers involved in fataiaccidents annual-ly
are violating a speed law at the time of the accident, &quot; Chief Elar said.
Because many factors enter into the making of every accident. Chief
Elar said it is impossible to determine to what extent speed is to blam e
in any single accident. However he pointed out that we know enough about speed
to make us realize that it&#x27;s dynamite if used unwisely. Chief Elar said that a
car with good brakes can stop in about 21 feet after the brakes are applied from
a speed of 20 miles per hour. It will take about 189 feet for the car to stop if
the speed is 60 miles per hour.
Another dangerous factor about speed, Chief Elar said, is that force of
impact is increased much more rapidly than speed. &quot;In other words, &quot;Chief
Elar said, &quot;if your car hits a fixed obstacle when you&#x27;re going 20 miles an
hour it will suffer as much damage as if it were dropped from a height of 13
feet onto a concrete highway. But if you hit the same object when you&#x27;re do-ing
60, the car will be damagedas much as if it were dropped,from a 10-story
building. &quot;

NEW INDUSTRY
Among the industries scheduled for operation in Freeport is the Weschler
Thermometer Co. of Manhattan, the construction of which will be located on
East Merrick Road -west of Buffalo Avenue. Groundbreaking ceremonies were
participated in by the members of the Village Board, as a preliminary to the
erection of a $250,000 structure. The first shovelful of earth was spaded by
Trustee Edmund T. Cheshire, substituting for Mayor Glacken, who was unable
to attend the function because &#x27;of illness. Among the other participants of the
ceremonies were Trustee Cord Viebrock, Robert Kurz, President of the Free-port
Chamber of Commerce; Donald McLaren, its executive secretary; Vi
Sargeant Nixon of the Freeport Bank and Emil Frenger of the Meadowbrook
National Bank--all of whom made brief talks.
POLYTECHNIC LABORATORY
Mayor Glacken&#x27;represented the Village at the dedication ceremonies of
the areodynamic laboratory of the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute on Atlantic
Avenue and &quot;Westend. The official Village party was welcomed by Dr. H.
Rogers. President of the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute accompanied by Dr.
Nicholas Hoff, head of the Aeronautical Engineering Department, and Dr.
Antonio Ferri, &#x27; who will supervise the work at the laboratory. The Army and
Navy Departments are cooperating with the Polytechnic Institute in the develop-ment
of new instruments and designs for super sonic flight. It is anticipated
that the Laboratory will be the means of important advance in the science of
aviation.
BEAUTIFICATION OF FREEPORT FOR THE FUTURE
Upon re commendation of the new appointed Beautification Committee the
Village Board is conducting an investigation for the type of .tree most suitable
for planting in the residential areas.
Dr. M. G. Isenberg, Chairman of the Committee, has submitted a re -
port to the Board pointing out specifically the advantages of &quot;the dogwood tree
and with the suggestion that it be declared the pffical tree of the Village, with
the idea in mind of eventually replacing all shade trees of other .varieties and
substituting the dogwood. Further, the advantages of the dogwood are that they
present a showy display of beauty in bloom in early spring, a&#x27;showy display of
red leaves and berries in the autumn and an interesting silhouette in the win-ter.
They are adaptable to shaping a nd pruning. They .dp not present the problem
of shallow roots which raise the sidewalks and destroy other types of shrubs
and grass within their reach as do the current group of swamp maples preval-ent
through out the Village. - •
PARKS AND RECREATION NEWS
The Freeport Park Commission is pleased to announce that consider-able
progress has been made in the development of park facilities and the or-ganization
of the community recreation program. The following will acquaint
Freeport residents of the many youth and family recreational opportunities a-vailable.
THE PARKS
Northeast Park consists of seven acres located between Commercial
Street and Parsons Avenue. It provides a multiple use recreation area with
four basketball courts, a children&#x27;s playground and a picnic grove with fire-places
and tables. The first of several hard surface tennis courts is be ing con-structed.
NorthwestP ark, located on Brooks ide Avenue north of Sunrise Highway,
will be dedicated on July 5th. This three-acre park, now in the final stage of
completion, has a children&#x27;s playground, a multiple use recreation area with
t;.vo basketball courts and two handball courts, a. baseball diamond and a gener-al
pJay area.
Waterfront P ark, located at the south end of Long Beach Avenue, affords
an opportunity to enjoy the waterfront. There will be a small children&#x27;s play-
2;rcimd, and a park building for public use.
Randall Park with eight acres, offers a children&#x27;s playground, basket-ball
courts, handball courts, an athletic field with three ball diamonds and a
general athletic area.
Night lighting is being installed at all the parks on multiple use recrea-tion
areas to allow additional use of the park facilities. All the parks have rest
room facilities.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RECREATION PROGRAM
The Village has operated a Parks Department for many years which has
been responsible for the development and maintenance of the Parks and the Sta-dium
in Freeport, Last September a Recreation Department was inaugurated
to provide community recreation activities in close cooperation with the Board
of Education. The primary objective is to provide wholesome, constructive
recreation activities for Freeport girls and boys and adults of all ages ona
year-round basis. During the winter season 28 activities were conducted week-ly,
and the total attendance for recreation sessions was 8,808. The activities
consisted of instructions in Arts and Crafts, Square Dancing, Group Games,
relays, Tumbling, informal play. Basketball and a Teen-Age Social Program,
under the supervision of capable trained leaders. During the Spring recrea-tion
supervision and instruction are provided daily after school from 3:30to
5:30 P.M. and from 10:00 A.M. to 12:00 noon on Saturday, at Northeast Park
and Randall Park. A variety of activities were provided for the youngsters dur-ing
Easter Vacation Week and it is most encouraging to report that 3,425 attend-ed
Randall Park while 2, 525 enjoyed the activities at Northeast Park. One of the
highlights of the vacation program was the exciting Easter Egg Hunt which more
than 100 Freeport youngsters enjoyed.
SUMMER PROGRAM
The recreation Department will provide a daily recreation program at
Randall, Northwest and Northeast Parks during the entire summer vacation.
The details of the program will be announced at a later date. In addition to the
scheduled recreation activities the parks are open seven days a week for infor-mal
recreation. Freeport children and adults are encouraged to enjoy these
public facilities.
The Recreation Department has issued permits to 24 baseball and soft-ball
teams to use the park ball diamonds at least once or twice a week. The Free-port
Stadium is accommodating athletic events as well as the Pony League, Sen-ior
B aseball L eague, and the American Legion Baseball &#x27;Bam on Monday,Wednes -
day and Thursday evenings from 6:00 to 10:30 P.M.
On Friday, June llth, at 9 P. M. the thirteenth Annual Inter-Collegiate,

for June 16th at 8:30 P.M. at the Stadium, when the Freeport Old Timers
meet the High School Team.
Additional recreation activities will be announced from time to time
The newly established community recreation program is most appreciative for
the excellent cooperation that it has receivedfrom the FreeportSchools and the
numerous Freeport organization.

<dc:description>SIDEWALK RESPONSIBILITY
The attention of property owners is called to Village Ordinance # 7. 103--
Duty of Making Sidewalk Repairs: The Law reads as follows:
&quot;It shall be the duty of every property owner or occupant to keep the side-walk
and curb adjoining his premises in safe, passable condition. For failure
upon notice by the Village Clerk of not less then twenty-four (24) hours to make
such repairs as are specified as to place and manner, the Board of Trustees
may cause the same to be done and assess the expense thereof upon adjoining
land.&quot;
&quot;Where there are No Existing Sidewalks, the power is in the Village
Board of Trustees to order their construction under the same provision of the
Law that makes it possible for the Board to compel the Repairs to Sidewalk.
To date the property owners have done a fine job in cooperating with the
Village Board in their effort to eliminate walking hazards.
Inspect your sidewalk for defects such as raised and/or broken flags. If
you find you have existing hazards call at Village Office for a list of Licensed
sidewalk contractors or phone Freeport 8-4000 for any information you might
need about getting your work done.
Lets not wait until someone falls on your sidewalk due to defective side-walk.
Remember patching is not permitted where the sidewalk is not level.
A MESSAGE FROM FIRE CHIEF NOLL FOR FIRE PREVENTION WEEK
OCTOBER 4th to llth, 1954
With the approach of October our thoughts turn to Fall and the changing
of the leaves which glow in all their beauty in shades of rust, gold, brown and
fiery-red, signalling the close of summer and the nearness of winter. But
these leaves are not only objects of beauty-they become danger signs as well
for theyaredry and brittle and as they drift from the treesand lay in dead piles
on the streets their glamour has fled and all that is left is a job to be done.
When doing that job keep in mind &quot;FIRE PREVENTION WEEK&quot; October 4th to
llth and the need to observe the ordinance of the Village regarding the burning
of leaves: &quot;No person shall burn LEAVES, paper or refuse of any kind on any
street or public place in the Village within fifty (50) feet of any building, un-less
the material burned shall be contained in a receptacle constructedof iron
or wire and completely covered with an iron or wire top so closely woven as to
prevent the flying of ashes therefrom.&quot;
We di slike spoiling the beauty of Fall but we must urge you to be cautious
because while the tang of Autumn is synonomous with the burning of leaves the
danger is ever-present and must be avoided.
NOTICE .TO OWNERS OF BICYCLES
The Police Department advises that too many bicycles are being collect-ed
in the Police Dept. If the owners of bicycles will make a permanent record
of th e serial number (usually found around the sprocket or on the rear end of
the bike) -even thoughan attempt has been made to change the appearance, the
owner will have no difficulty in identifying his own bicycle.

First, it is of-great help to the Village if the occupants.of homes*dispose
of their own accumulation of leaves, papers and other readily combustible ma-terials.
. In doing so they relieve the strain upon the Sanitation Department and
make, for a cleaner Village. In.doing so, however, local ordinances require
that nobody shall burn .leaves or other refuse on streets or public places within
50 feet of ra* building unless the material burned is contained in a receptacle of
iron or wire, covered with an iron or wire top to prevent the flying of&#x27;ashes
therefrom.
i
If it is desired to burn rubbish or refuse on one&#x27;s own property, the or-dinance
requires that the burning be done in a screened metal receptacle or
outdoor fire place and in such manner or such circumstances as not to cause
unreasonable annoyance to others through the spreading of smoke and ashes
and in such manner that the property is not endangered.
&quot;- Owners and occupants of property in any section of the Village are not
permitted to accumulat e dr ied grass, weeds f brush, waste paper, barrels,
boxes or other combustible flammable material on their nremises, except such
as is placed in containers or is bundled and tied and placed convenient for col-lection
by the Sanitation Department.
TAX SETTLEMENT BY LONG ISLAND RAILROAD
In conformity with the findings of the Bankruptcy Court the Board of Trust-ees
of the Village of Freeport, accepted from the Long Island Railroad, taxes.
in the amount of $23,278. 72 for the payment .of tax arrears for the years&quot; 1949
to 1954, inclusive. These monies were received by the Village in line with
similar settlements made by the Long Island Railroad with other Lonj Island
Villages and as approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
GRADE ELIMINATION PROJECT
Notice from the Public Service Commission to the effect that the Rail-road
grade elimination in Freeport and neighboring Baldwin will begin in the
immediate future. In anticipation of the construction the Public Service com-mission
has granted the Long Island Railroad an extension of the time within
which to place a barrier gate and bell signal at the Brookside Avenue crossing.
la the meantime the R ailroad is ordered to continue the services of a watchman
in conformity with the order issued after the Village had pointed out the danger
inherent at the unprotected crossing.
Meanwhile the Village Board is arranging final details for the transfer of
property east of Henry Street north-of Sunrise Highway for the development of
the Station Plaza parking field. Preliminary designs by the Village Engineer
call for the location on the property, which is being acquired from Jacob Post,
a total of somewhat in the neighborhood of 131 cars. There will be added to this
when the grade crossing elimination is completed 455 cars. The Station Plaza
when completed will accomodate approximately a total of 600 cars. &#x27;The sheet
metal building, formerly occupied by MackCorwin as a storage warehouse has
been removed in preparation for the improvement of the area.
PLAQUE AWARD
A distinctive honor was conferred upon the Village of Freeport particu-larly
its Police Department and its Municipal Court by the American Bar Asso-ciation,
in the award of a plaque, designating the Village as the first of its type
of community in the United States in regard to traffic safety. The award was
made on October 18, 1954 by Mr. J. Dwyer Spellman on behalf of the American
Bar Association who said in part: &quot;You have accomplished in the Village of
Freeport through your traffic court and police department what constitutes an
outstanding record in the entire United States for cities and villages between
10,000 and 25,000 population.
Mr. Spellman presented the plaque to Mayor Glacken, who in turn pre-sented
it to Police Justice Paul E. Kelly.

, TEACH HIM SAFE
WALKING HABITS
THE SAFEST WAY 10 walk to
school or wherever. he may go and
safety rules for crossing streets should
be taught to your child before he begins
achuul. Find (he safest route to school
and use it when you take him to school,
giving him safety pointers every day. By
the time he goes to school alone he will
have learned the safest way.
SAFETY
A child&#x27;s life is far more valuable than any
time that might be saved by speeding, Chief
Peter Elar of the Freeport Police Department,
said in .urging e veryone in the community to
workfor the success of a child safety progra m
organized by the Police Bureau of the State
Division of Safety.
&quot;It&#x27;s going to take the combined efforts of
motorists, parents and children to keep our
youngsters safe in traffic.
Four thousand four hundred children under
fifteen years of age were killed in motor vehicle
accidents last year. The problem of protecting
youngsters in this age group is one of the most
challenging facing,us today.
Everyone&#x27;s cooperation is needed to help
assure .the highest possible degree of child
safety. &quot;
The parent&#x27;s role in this program is espe-cially
imp&#x27;ortant. Chief Elar said, in pointing
aut that fathers and mothers can select play
areas removed from busy highways and danger-ous
intersections. &quot;•&#x27;•- &quot; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; i:&quot; - •
Parents &quot;&#x27;should strive to teach good safety habits. This can be done most
effectively by good example. If&#x27;parents and;adults consistently practice safety
rules, youngste&#x27;rs will soon follow in their footsteps. &quot;&quot; &quot;
Despite the best training however, &#x27;children may&quot; occasionally actunwisely
in traffic. &#x27;It is then that the motorist should-dohis part, Chief Elar said.
Drivers should be extra-cautious in school areas, around playgrounds, in&#x27;
residential districts and at &#x27;other places &quot;where children gather.
Children should also do the best they can by walking, and playing safely,
and observing all the various rules they have been taught.
The schools are doing&#x27;a good job ofteaching safety, the Chief said, and the
police intend to do all that they can to keep children safe. The program can
help reduce accidents only if everyone gives it his full support.
THOUGHT FOR THE MOTORIST Be tolerant with the pedestiran.
has his faults, but they are not crimes punishable by death;
&#x27;
He
Mayor G lacken received w ord from the Northwestern University of Chicago
that a certificate of merit has been awarded to.Sergeant Anthony N. Elar of the
Freeport Police Department. Sgt. Elar completed a special traffic training
course given by the U niversity with high honors. Letter to Mayor Glacken said

MARINE INDUSTRIES DISTR-ICT CONSIDERED
With the expansion of F reeport and its rapid increase in population various
suggestions for modifying the zoning ordinance have been presented to the Vil-lage
Board. Among the proposals under consideration is one toestablish in the
waterfront sections a type of zoning d esignaled as &quot;Marine Industries District. &quot;
The general idea would be to preserve the characteristics of waterfront areas
similar to those on Cape Cod. Generally, the uses permitted in this district
proposed such establishments as devoted to the sale and display of boats, r.va-rine
supplies, fishing and sporting equipment and the like; the manufacture and
repair of boats within enclosed buildings; the sale of marine products of various,
types and other industries associated with waterfront activites. It is suggested
that there be provided facilities for the operation of restaurants, for the sale
of foods, for the renting of clock spaces, boats and accessories and limiting on
the use of the area for residential purposes. Mayor Glacken has appointed a
Committee consisting of the following with Trustee Viebrock as Chairman:
Trustee Cheshire, Wilbert F. DeMott, Supt. of Buildings, Mr. Edmund Lum-ley,
Jr. , Mr. Carl Hellsten and Mr. Nathan Zablow. This Committee has been
considering in detail the various suggestions and propose to hold a public hear-«
ing at some future time for further discussion.

. . . &#x27;MUNICIPAL TORT&#x27;LIABILITY
The Village of Freeport was represented at the meeting of the Municipal
Tort Liability&#x27;held on December 3rd,,1954 at the Bar Building, NewYorkCity.
The purpose of the meeting held under the auspices of the Joint Legislation Com-mittee
.appointed by the State Legislature was to present, views of various mu-nicipalities
on the law as it relates to negligence, against cities arid villages.
The representative at the meeting for the Village of Freeport, was Martin H.
Weyrauch, Village Counsel, w ho is Chairman of the Pilot Committee of the New
York State. Conference of Mayors, which has been active in the promotion of
legislation to provide greater protection to the taxpayers of Villages against
claims brought in negligence action.
Counsel Weyrauch pointed out various reasons why the taxpayers should
have relief from municipal tort claims in order to keep the tax rate down. As
a result of this movement, it is hoped that the State Legislature will adopt laws
providing for the relief suggested.

BE AWARE OF YOUR DOGS
The Board of Trustees has made ap plication to the Town of Hempstead for
the control of stray dogs within the Village limits. The Town has an animal
shelter atWantagh and has a dog warden under whose direction the department
is operated. If the arrangement is concluded&#x27; the procedure will be for. the Town&quot;
warden or his deputies to seize all. dogs running at large within the. Village. ••
The seized dogs will be impounded at the animal shelter.
For the past several years the Village has had its dog ordinance made ef-fective
in cooperation with the Long Island Humane Association but due to the
adoption of certain State Legislation the Continuance of the Association has beer,
found t o b e impractical. ...
Village Ordinance #1.2 prohibits owners of dogs from letting them run at
large in any of the streets or public places of the Village unless effectively re-strained
by cha&#x27;in or leash not more than six feet long.
A violation of this ordinance carries a.rnaximun penalty of $25. 00. This
is in addition to the liability of&#x27;&#x27;ons not so restrained being picked up, impound-ed
and subject upon redemption c£paying fees.</dc:description>

FREEPORT GROWTH CONTINUES
Plans have been filed with Wilbert DeMott, Superintendent of Buildings,
for the opening, as a new development, the large area in the Northwest sec-tion
of Freeport along both sides of Brookside Avenue. The development is to
be known as Brookside Acres. It takes in all of the property formerly used by
the Milburn Country Club as golf links, located within the Village of Freeport.
The plans call for the development of six sections on which will be located 200
residences. The immediate plans call for development of Section lv and the
Village Board has granted permits for the erection of three model houses. The
developer will construct all roads, sidewalks, curbs, and install water and sewer
mains. The map as filed shows seven new streets,- tentatively designated as,
Birchwood Drive, Willowbrook Lane, Tanglewood Road, Delaware Avenue Ex-tension,
Meadow Lane, Brookside Circle, and Milburn Circle.
ORDINANCES TO PROVIDE SAFETY
Among the provisions of the new Code of Ordinances are two intended
to give special protection to the traveling public. One of these ordinances re-quires
that before any one makes an opening in a street, he must apply for a
permit from the Village Clerk. The other ordinance requires similar proced-ure
when any one wishes to use any part of a street or sidewalk to pile up lum-ber,
sand, or other building materials. There have been several accidents
and near accidents recently,because of a disregardof these requirements.and
Police C hief Elar has instructed his men to report any violations however slight.
APPRECIATION
Mrs. Clara Barry, age 81, writes to the Village Board that she is more
than grateful to the Police Department, especially to Officer John Raynor.for
the thoughtful and kindly care they gave her when called by a neighbor to pro-vide
emergency relief. Mrs.Barry had fallen during a heart attack,and injured&#x27;
herself severly.

ZONING CHANGES
Four proposed changes of village zones brought a large group of citi-zens
to the public hearing called by the Village Board. After consideration,
the Board granted the application for two changes and denied the other two.
The two approved extend the manufacturing zone inthe easterhMerrickRoad
sector of the village. One runs south along Liberty Avenue from Sunrise High-way
to the northern boundry of Hanse Park. The other extends along the wes-terly
side of Albany Avenue and north of Merrick Road for a distance of a-bout350
feet. The erection of modern type one-story factory buildings in the
area is anticipated.
The Board denied the application to make a Business &quot;B&quot; zone out of
South Bergen Place from Merrick Road to Sunrise Highway. Under Busi-ness
&quot;B&quot; provisions, many types of business and industry might be estab -
lished that would substantially depreciate the character of the neighborhood
which contains such fine buildings as the Memorial Library, the PostOffice,
the Elks&#x27; Clubhouse, the Medical Center and others. The Board is investi-gating
the possibility of providing a more restricted type of business zone,
to limit business structures to what might be described as &quot;garden - type&quot;
stores, with ample parking fields and other attractive features.
The Board also refused to rezone. South Ocean Avenue between Suffolk
Street and Hamilton Avenue, into a residential zone. With the co-operation
of the Waterfront Committee and leaders of Civic Associations, plans&#x27;are be-ing
compiled to provide a new type of zone^limiting businesses to those nat-urally
associated with waterfront activities, such as - shipyards, yacht clubs,
stores for sale of marine products, and the like.
SCHOOL FOR FIREMEN
Fire Chief John Marra reports that seven volunteer instructors are con-ducting
regular classes for new recruits and members of the auxiliary force
in,the latest methods of fire-fighting. To aid in the instruction, the Village
Board has authorized the purchase of a motion picture projector and screen
to be taken tothe various firehouses for display of&#x27;technical f ir e - fight ing

GRADE CROSSING ELIMINATION |
Word comes from the higher echelons of government that the Public&#x27;
Service Commission has made it a first order of business for 1953 to see that
the Freeport-Baldwin Grade Elimination Project gets full legislative support.
What is needed is a substantial appropriation of funds to cover the heavy costs
of the undertaking. The State Department of Public Works has been alerted
and will be ready with the detailed plans as soon as the money is available.
NASSAU COUNTY OFFICIALS MEET
The Freeport V illage Board was host to Nassau County Village Officials
on December 9. This group meets regularly to discuss matters of mutual con-cern
to villages. The December meeting heard in detail about the rising costs
to taxpayers because of accident claims. Mayor Doxsee told of the experiences
of some of the communities which had substantially raised tax rates,&#x27; and then
introduced Village Counsel Martin Weyrauch, who told of the work done by a
committee of which he is chairman, appointed to work out a new law that &quot;would
lighten the tax burden from such causes. The Mayor and Village Counsel at-tended
a session of the Legislative Committee of the State Conference of May-ors,
on December 16, to discuss the.draft of a bill to be submitted to the Leg-islature.
Donald Walsh, Counsel to the Mayors Conference, attended the Free-port

claims to cities and villages through out the State.

*
&#x27; • The staff of Village employees lost a notable figure in the death of Wi-lliam
K. Holmes, veteran Chief Electrician at the Fbwer Plant, who died on
Monday, January 19, 1953.
Mr. Holmes was born on December 10, 1886, in Greenwich, N. J. Asa
young man, he began his active service as a railroad worker at Vineland, N.J.
He showed an intense interest in the newly developing field of electricity, and
finally secured a position with the Philadelphia Electric Company, where he ad-vanced
rapidly in his chosen occupation. Whenthe federal government took over
the Panama Canal Zone, he was called as an electrician to participate in the in-stallation
of the complicated electrical apparatus operating the locks of the fa-mous
Canal. From there he went to the General Electric Company, and while
working for them he was called upon, in 1932, to help install and supervise the
apparatus in the Freeport Power Plant. The work completed, he joined the Power
Plant personnel on January 21, of that year, and had acted as Chief Electrician
since that time.
Mr. Holmes had the affectionate esteem of his fellow workers in the Po-wer
Plant and among the other employees of the Village. He leaves a widow ,
Mrs. HelenHolmes; one daughter, Mrs. Edna Garretson;and one granddaughter.
Funeral services, under the auspices of the Freeport Elks Club, were held on
Wednesday evening, January 21, and for the Public on Thursday, January 22.
Internment at Greenfield Cemetery.

Design for Freeport&#x27;s Federally Financed Housing Project
FEILHEIMER, WAGNER «. VOLLMER
iSCHITSCTS &amp;
The above architect&#x27;s sketch shows the design for the FreeportHousing
Project, to be financed out of funds provided for such purposes by the
Federal Government. The design was prepared under direction of the
Freeport Housing Authority, in conformity with the vote by the Village
electorate. The Housing Authority consists of John M. Woerner, Chain,
man; Moxey Rigby, Vice Chairman; the Rev. Father John J. Madden;-
Benjamin J. Reiner, Secretary; and Philip Nickelsberg. The Admin-istrative
staff consists of Lester H. Baumann, Counsel; Thomas W.
Cann, Executive Director; Mrs. Dorothy V. Walsh, stenographer and
bookkeeper. The architects, who have designed numerous similar pro-jects,
are Fellheimer, Wagner . and Vollmer.
The Authority has held numerous meetings with the Village Board to
discuss details. Although the Freeport project is under the Federal
Plan, it is necessary to conform with the New York State Public Hous-ing
Law, which requires prior approval by the Planning Commission
and the Village of a site before its adoption. Approval was finally made
by the Planning Commission and the Village Board of the site located
at the northwest corner of Merrick Road and Buffalo Avenue. There
followed tentative approval of the site by the Public Housing Adminis-tration
with instructions to proceed with the preparation of the Devel-opment
Program. Contracts have been negotiated with Baldwin and
Cornelius for Land Survey; Robert E. Patterson and Gabriel C. De
Costerd for Appraisals; Title Guarantee and Trust Company for Title
Policies; and Roy Wenzlick for a Housing Survey. Fellheimer, Wag-ner
and Vollmer and Baldwin &amp; Cornelius are preparing data for use
in formulating the Development Program. This program is important
for the information it conveys. The Public Housing Administration
will finally determine whether or not the project is feasible. Upon
determining the practicability of the project, the Public Housing Ad-ministration
will give its approval, after which land acquisition and
physical development of the Project will be undertaken.</dc:description>

VILLAGE ELECTION DETAILS
In conformity with the provisions of the Village Law, setting the third
Tuesday in March, annually, as the legal date, -the date of Freeport&#x27;s village
election this year is March 17. A Mayor and two Trustees, to succeed Mayor
Doxsee and Trustees Baker and Glacken, will be elected.
Preparations begin each year for the village election, as early as Jan-uary,
when the Village Clerk procures from the County Board of Elections the
official registration books, containing the names of all eligible voters regis-tered
the previous Fall. All those on the lists are eligible to vote at the village
election without further formality. Those who are not registered may do so on
registration day, which by law is set ten days before the .election. The Village
Clerk also is furnished with the official list of election inspectors, whose posi-tions
require them to serve both on registration day and election day.
Voting machines, provided by the County, are installed and tested well
before election day. The County also supplies the routine furnishings and ma-terials
needed in taking and tallying the vote. Up-to-the-minute instructions
are supplied to chairman of each election district the day before election day
and registration day, for the information and guidance of election workers.
In the meantime, representatives of parties or groups who wish to pre-sent
candidates, circulate nominating petitions for required signatures. Such
petitions must be filed with the Village Clerk fourteen days prior to election.
After their receipt, the Clerk is required to publish a legal notice setting forth
the names of all duly designated candidates. He also notifies each candidate of
the provision of lav/ which requires him, within twenty days after election, to
file an itemized statement of his campaign expenditures.
After election, the Board of Trustees is required to convene, to re -
ceive from the Village Clerk a tabulated return of the vote, given to him by the
inspectors of election. The Board canvasses the returns and files in the office
of the Village Clerk a certificate of the results. All duly elected candidates
must qualify for office by filing affidavits of their eligibility, and by taking the
oath of office.
H OW The VILLAGE GROWS
Reports for the calendar year of 1952 show that new buildings erected
or planned for immediate construction in Freeport are 255 in number, and have
an estimated value of $2,908,033.00. More than two hundred applications were
filed for additions and alterations, valued at $546,175.00.
CHILDREN LIKE The BOOKMOBILE
The Freeport Memorial Library&#x27;s handsome Bookmobile has been run-ning
on its regular schedule around the town more than two months, and Mrs .
Elizabeth Kelly, Librarian, announces that during that time nearly 2500 books
have been borrowed from its shelves. This mobile library is equipped to serve
the whole community but figures show that our young people have used it more
than the adults, having borrowed 2400 books, while their elders withdrew only
100. The new Bookmobile is well worth your inspection and every one should
make a point of visiting it at one of the neighborhood stops.
The addition of the Bookmobile was the answer to a need for increased
library, coverage of Freeport. More interest in the Library and library activi-ties
have correspondingly been stimulated. Those Freeporters who wish to
select books and other materials from the whole collection of 44,476 books ,
come to the Library on Merrick Road. Of this number of books, 4, 167 were
new books added during 1952. For those coming to the Library on MerrickRoad
to do reference work, there is now a trained Reference Librarian, ready to be
of assistance . Reference books, particularly some of use to business men, have
been added to the total book collection.

FREEPORT VILLAGE OFFICE - When Freeport Was 14 Years Old
In 1906, fourteen years after its charter was granted, the Freeport
Village Office was located on the second floor of the building at #29 Railroad
Avenue, Freeport. At that time, the late Hiram R. Smith was Village Presi-dent
and Sylvester P. Shea was Village Clerk. The rent was $12.00 per month
including heat and light, and the lease -which is on file in the Municipal Build-ing
-provided for an extension of another year at a rental not to exceed $15.00
per month. The tall man in front of the first office of the First National Bank
(now the Meadowbrook National Bank) is C. Milton Foreman, and the shorter
man standing in the center doorway is the late Ernest S. Randall, who was the
Village President in 1916 and 1917.
WORDS OF PRAISE
Mrs. Frances E. Bates of 37 Miller Street, Merrick, N. Y. , recently
congratulated the Police Department, under the able leadership of Chief Elar,
on their efficiency, which she felt others in the County might very well emu-late.
Especial praise and appreciation was given to the P. B.C. Director for
the wonderful work he is doing for the youth of Freeport. Mrs. Bates said it
is regrettable that so many citizens take the Police Department for granted,
which fact prompted her to write to the Village Board.</dc:description>

<dc:description>MEMO TO DOG OWNERS
The Village Clerk calls attention to the fact that some owners have
failed to renew licenses for their pets, to conform with the State Law. It is
necessary that licenses be procured and owners who have failed to observe the
provision are subject to summons to court. Dog licenses fall due on January
first of each year. To keep record of animals subject to licenses, the Police
Department takes a dog census each December and January. This census is
used as a basis of report which the Village is required to make to the State,
annually by February 10th. The most recent census indicates that there are
in excess of Z.OOO dogs in Freeport. The cooperation of owners in procuring
licenses will be appreciated by the office of the Village Clerk.
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
The matters considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals and the de-cisions
reached at its hearings in March, are as follows:
1. Appeal and application for variance filed by Otto Winther, 35 St. Marks Av.
Freeport, to permit revision of plans originally submitted and which applica-tion
for variance came before the Zoning Board of Appeals at public hearing
on September 17, 1952, at which time application .was granted to erect a build-ing
to be used as a Super-Market on the southwest corner of Atlantic Avenue
and St. Marks Avenue, eliminating certain prescribed setback on St.MarksAv.
and protruding into residential area on property owned by Mr. Winther on St.
Marks Avenue. The present application was for revision of plans to provide
for an addition to the building for which a variance was granted as stated.
The present application was also granted.
2. Appeal and application filed by Raymond Barrett and Agnes Barrett, of 25
Washburn Avenue,Freeport, for variance to permit continuance of two-family
dwelling, which is in violation of Ordinance 10. 1 (Sec. 6D 8t F). A variance
was granted sometime ago for the conversion of this property to a two-family
house for a three year period, and through oversight, application for contin-uance
as two-family house was omitted upon expiration of the three year per-iod.
Present application was granted permanently.
3. Appeal and application filed byBalport Sales and Service, Inc., 425 W. Sun-rise
Highway, Freeport, for variance to permit buying, selling and dealing in
new and used automobiles on property located on south side of Sunrise High-way,
approximately 210 feet east of Park Avenue, Freeport, which is in viol-
. ation of Ordinance 10. 1 (Sec. 9A-4). In addition to the violation of provisions
governing the operations of a used car lot, this property extends into residen-tial
area on Centre Street. Application was denied.

DINNER For RETIRING MAYOR DOXSEE
Friends of Robert L. Doxsee, who refused renomination as Mayor,
because of the press of business, have planned a dinner in his honor to beheld
Thursday evening. May 21, at the South Shore Yacht Club. Former Mayor
Doxsee&#x27;s record of public service for the past few years includes the institu-tion
of a park programme for all parts of the Village, completion of the first
phase of parking field, public housing, and sewer expansion projects, extension
of municipal power plant facilities, and - on the side - completion of a stren-uous
campaignto secure government aid in dredging Jones Inlet and safeguard-ing
substantial areas at Point Lookout from being washed out to sea.
CIVIL DEFENSE
The Civil Defense Organization still continues its varied activities
with monthly meetings of its personnel chiefs, and recently special emphasis
has been placed on the need for additional volunteers for the Ground Observer
Corps. With the cooperation of the Nassau County CivilDefense personnel, the
Air Force is arranging a caravan illustrating the latest devices in this phase
of activity. The caravan will remain in Freeport from 9:00a.m. to ll:00p.m.
on April 17, at the Grove Theatre. It is hoped that this may be a means of sti-mulating
volunteer enrollments for the Ground Observer Corps.
SAFETY IN FREEPORT
The Village has been following a comprehensive plan for employees&#x27;
safety with very good results. Safety meetings are held at least quarterly .with
a program arranged by the State Insurance Fund, our compensation insurance
carrier, and generally these meetings have been well attended. The constant
efforts of those in charge, with the cooperation of the department heads, has
resulted in a reduction in personal injury accidents which not only benefits the
employees but the Village on a whole, in the reduction of compensation rates.

PRANKSTERS CAN COST THE VILLAGE MONEY
The following item is reproduced from the New York State Munic-ipal
Bulletin: •
11 The Ossining Village Board has authorized a $58,500. bond&#x27;issue
to pay the outstanding portion of a judgment that arose from a street accident.
It was alleged by the plaintiffs in the case against the Village of Ossining that
the liability of the Village was based upon its failure to replace a stop sign that
had been removed by Halloween pranksters. The total judgment was $66, 000,
but interest has brought this to more than $70,000.
Judgments, for this type are viewed with great alarm by the May-ors&quot;
Conference and Municipal Officials throughout the State. A committee of
municipal attorneys within the Mayors&#x27;Conference has been studying this pro-blem
of municipal tort liability to determine methods of limiting same to the
best interests of the Villages without jeopardizing the interests of the injured
persons. Martin Weyrauch, Counsel of the Village of Freeport, heads this im-
:portant&#x27;committee. This past year Mr. Weyrauch has spoken to the village of-ficials
of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, on the growing problem of
the cost, of such liability.
The Pilot Committee expects to make a report at the annual meet-ing
of the Mayors&#x27; Conference, to be held at Lido Beach on June 17, 18, and the
- 19th. It is expected that suggestions will be made for the adoption of remedial
laws at the next session &#x27;of the State Legislature.
NORTHEAST PARK OPENS
GOOD NEWS! The Freeport Park Commission is pleased to an-nounce
that applications are now being accepted for permits to use the picnic
area facilities at the Northeast park. Our first permit was issued to the Free-port
Girl Scouts, to hold a &quot;cook-out&quot; on June 10th. The Columbus Avenue
School will also hold their annual field day in the Park.
Permits will be issued upon a &#x27;phone call to FReeport 8 - 4000,
or a visit to the Village office. The playground equipment is completely in-stalled,
the roller skating rink is ready for use, and the picnic area is equipped
with tables and benches. Use of the fireplaces allowed only by permit under
the proper supervision of an adult.
&#x27;t is °i!r sincere hope to be able to announce the opening of Water-front
Park within a very short time.

Counsel from April 1 927 until his appointment as Police Justice, upon the death
of his brother in July 1933. He was elected to office as Police Justice in 1935,
which office he held until the time of his death.
Judge Johnson was one of the stalwarts of the Freeport Fire De-partment,
a charter member, and for many years active in Hose Company #4.
The Village Board adopted resolutions »which were spread on the
minutes in tribute to Justice Johnson&#x27;s memory.

NEW WATER RATES
A new schedule has been announced for use of water through out the
Village. This marks the first substantial increase in Water Rates since 1928.
The new schedule was adopted by the Board of Trustees after an investigation
by the engineering firm of Barker &amp; Wheeler, and a study of conditions cover-ing
nearly a year. Increased costs resulted in the operation of the Freeport
Water Department in the red, so thatthe amounts not paid by water users were
made up annually in taxes.
An investigation shows that the Freeport Water Department is con-stantly
undergoing growth and change. Several developments will become ur-gent
within a couple of years. These include: (1) Another large well, with its
pumping equipment to cost about $90, 000 ; (2) Replacement of outmoded and
small mains with modern large mains for about $85,000. The new schedule is
intended to make possible the creation of those new facilities, which will prim-arily
be financed out of a bond issue.
The new rates will add approximately 15% to present water bills, and
will still be considerably below those of water users in communities supplied
by private services through out the State.
The new r&#x27;ates are as follows:
FLAT RATE SCHEDULE
First outlet, minimum charge $8.50
Wash tubs &quot; 1.25
Bath-room (without toilet) 2.50

USE OF HOSES
The County of Nassau, through Dr. Earle G. Brown, Health Commis-sioner,
proclaim a water emergency effective during the summer months, to
help conserve the Long Island water supply, all of which comes from rain sweep-ing
to the lower strata. Every householder is requested to co-operate with the
rules generally adopted. These rules provide that no fountains, hose or sprin-klers
are to be in use at any time except between the hours of 6 and 9 o&#x27;clock
in the morning and between 6 and 8 o&#x27;clock in the evening. The Superintendent
of the Water Department reports to the Board that there.has been practically
unanimous co-operation on the part of Freeporters in this conservation move-ment.
HOW ABOUT A PICNIC AT NORTHEAST PARK ?
The Park Commission invites the use of the picnic facilities at North-east
Park, where there is a delightfully shady grove of trees - a cool pleasant
place to eat out on a warm evening. Tables and benches have been provided,
as wellas fireplaces - where Dad can indulge in his culinary art and be chef for
the evening, while Mother relaxes and watches Junior having a whirl in the play-ground
area. Charcoal can be procured for the &#x27;wiener roast1 -in case you are
all set and find you have forgotten it. No special permit is necessary. All that
is required is to register with the Park Attendant before using the fireplaces.
The purpose of such registration is to safeguard the children, by having a re -
sponsible adult start and &#x27;tend to&#x27; the fire.

<dc:description>Pedestrian Protection
Yes, just one slip can mean death or
serious injury if you slip on the street
in front of an approaching automobile.
During these winter days when streets
are wet or covered with ice and snow,
watch every step you take, advises the
American Automobile Association.
Never rush across the street when it&#x27;s
icy. Avoid that fatal slip.
PEDESTRIAN SAFETY
All over the nation, and especially in urban
areas, pedestrian accidents form a substantial
part of the traffic death toll. Nationally, almost
one-fourth of the motor vehicle accident fatali-ties
are pedestrians. And in cities and towns
half of the traffic fatalities are pedestrians-. In
some urban areas as many as three out of four
persons killed in traffic are pedestrians.
Remember, that, even though you are not
directly involved in an accident, YOU may be
A contributing cause by your improper behavior
on the highways.

SPOT LIGHT FOR FREEPORT
Dear Mr. Mayor;
I have never written a letter of this kind before and am at a loss for words,
to say just what I mean.
Here in Freeport we have a small business &quot;The Modern LimbCo. &quot; head-ed
by a Mr. Bennington and I think he should receive some sort of recognition
for the good he is doing for the handicapped as well as Spot lighting Freeport,
N.Y.
I have recently retired, after 35 years with the New York Telephone Co.
and spend a great deal of time watching T. V. shows, and several times in the
past few weeks victims needing an artificial limb and no money to get it have
appeared on &quot;Strike it Rich&quot;, and each time Mr. Bennington has called with an
offer of a new limb. Last night (Wed. Nov. 10th) Mr. Bennington was on &quot;Strike
it Rich&quot;with ay oung wo man who had been measured for alimb and he promised
to have he r back in 3 weeks already to Waltz with out detecting the artificial limb.
Please excuse my goings on but I do think he deserves a &quot;Big Thank You&quot;,
&quot;Don&#x27;t You?

Last year the N ational F oundation spent 26 1/2 million dollars, develop-ing,
testing and administrating the new Salk vaccine, which is the great hope
to conquer this dread disease. On a voluntary basis, with a control group, this
vaccine was given free to all Freeport children in the fir st, second and third
grades. Meanwhile, thousands more contract Polio and need your help now.
After two bad years, we in Freeport were luckier in 1954 than our hard
hit neighbors in Long Beach and Levittown, but this year we may not again be
so fortunate.
That many will continue to live and walk, will you please help us to meet
this paramount need and that we may all discharge our responsibilities as citi-zens,
may we receive your donation-NOW thru the mail-send to Irene Sullivan,
Chairman, 110 Bedford Ave«Freeport, N.Y. for the Freeport March of Dimes,
or by a contribution on January 26th, 1955, when the Mothers&#x27; March will take
place. * * * * * * * * * * * * *

<dc:description>WINTER HAZARDS
Police Chief Elar calls attention to the fact tliat winter weather means
rain, snow, sleet, and ice--factors that spell DANGER to drivers. The arch-villains
in the winter driving picture are reduced visibility, inadequate tr&#x27;ac-&quot;
tion, and temperature changes. Statistics show that these conditions breed
traffic accidents. But often drivers are not aware of the degree to which such
conditions complicate the traffic picture and they do not make the necessary
adjustments in the&#x27;ir driving habits. Chief Elar offers six rules to help motor-ists
stay safe when the weather throws the book at them.
1. ACCEPT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
Accept your responsibility to do all in your power to drive without ac-cident.
Don&#x27;t blame the weatherman for an accident. Be prepared to meet the
situation.
2. GET THE &quot;FEEL&quot; OF THE ROAD
Try brakes occasionally while driving slowly and away from traffic.
Find out just how si ippery the road is anda djustyour speed toroad and weather
conditions. Remember, you can&#x27;t stop on an icy dime.
3. KEEP THE WINDSHIELD CLEAR
Keep the windshield clear of snow and ice, fog and frost. Besure head-lights,
windshield wiper blades and defrosters are in top condition. You have
to see danger to avoid it.
4. USE TIRE CHAINS AND GOOD TIRES
Don&#x27;t rely on worn-smooth tires. Use tire chains on snow and ice. They
cut stopping distances about half, give 4 to 7 times more starting and climbing
traction ability. But even with the help of chains, slower than normal speeds
are a &quot;must&quot; on snow and ice. . . .
5. PUMP YOUR BRAKES
Pump your brakes to slow down or stop. Jamming them on can lock the
wheels and throw you into a dangerous skid. A little skidding can carry you
a long way.
6. FOLLOW AT A SAFE DISTANCE
Keep well back of the vehicle ahead--give yourself room to stop. Re-member,
without tire chains, it takes 3 to 12 times as far to stop on snowand
ice as on dry concrete.

LETTER OF THANKS
Police Chief Elar:
I am writing this letter of thanks to your Patrolman Edwin Ellson.
x My son hurt himself while ice skating at Randall&#x27;s Park, Dec. 22nd.
I called the police and Patrolman Ellson was sent down. He was patient and
kindness itself. I had no car that day and he drove my son and myself to Dr.
Gladtke&#x27;s off ice. The boy had st itchesjsnd tetanusgivenhim.If Freeport had more
patient and kind people this village would be much better off. This is not the
first time that I know of the police doing their job and more. I have been told
that we people of Freeport arevery lucky to have such good men protecting
and serving our village. lam one who is indeed both grateful and thankful.
Again I say thank Patrolman Edwin Ellson. Mrs. Irene Spelina

immediate neighborhood of the transfer station by instituting action to .restrict
the hours of operation to those that would not interfere with the peace of week-ends
and the. quiet of.the nights. :The.matter was .taken-to. court, where, special
counsel, Lester Baumann, sought an injunction to.prohibit the use of .the prem-ises
for the loading and unloading of the arrival and. departure of .trucks, after
eight o&#x27;clock on week day evenings.- While the matter was pending the Krug
Baking Company announced that it would give up the location and remove its
business to the building., on East Sunrise Highway formerly,.occupied by the
..Wood-Ply.Corporation, where its operation is not in.the .immediate..neighbor-hood
of residents and,may be conducted without creating a disturbance. The
premises vacated by the Krug Baking Company have, now been occupied .by the

He forgot .... it can be more -than an
accident when a driver violates the law.
Too many times it&#x27;s murder!

A fine will be his punishment. His life

been taken in payment for this driver&#x27;s
neglect of traffic laws.

THANKS FOR POLICE PROTECTION
Dear Mayor Glacken:
About 2 years ago a car was stolen from my driveway early in the morn-ing
and within 2 hours after I reported the theft it was located by one of your
men. Last night I heard agrowler at the rear of my house and within 1 minute
after I notified Police H eadquarter s by telephone the prowl car was on the scene,
and 30 seconds later a second prowl car showed up. It certainly is a pleasure
to live in a community in which the Police Department members are so prompt
in re spending to calls and also are so courteous in their contact with the public.

ANNUAL REPORT--RECREATION DEPARTMENT
In December o f 1953, the first V illage Recreation Program was launched,
with a variety of activities. The general objective of this program is to pro- &#x27;
vide wholesome, constructive recreation activities for boys and girls of all
ages in every section of our community. Since the very beginning of the pro-gram,
a great deal of emphasis has been placed on the proper selection and
training of qualified leaders who were employed on a part-time basis to direct
the various activities.
The first year of operating the Municipal Program was an exceedingly
busy one which realized the development of numerous activities in athletics,
arts and crafts, square dancing, summer playgrounds, teen-age social ac-tivities,
adult basketball league, family recreation, many special events, etc.
.Various activities were conducted in the five elementary school gyms,
shops and cafeterias. During the Christmas vacation, the schools were open
daily;- which p rovided much needed recreation during the youngsters&#x27; idle time.
During the first winter of operation, 22 weekly activities&#x27;were conducted.
With the arrival of spring, the activities were &#x27;shifted to the out-doors
and a daily program was conducted at Randall and Northeast Parks after school
and Saturdays, and a Community Easter Egg Hunt was the highlight of a busy
vacation week.
During the summer months the Recreation Department inaugurated an
extensive ten week program under the direction of professional leadership at
the three Village Parks, which was conducted during the day and in the even-ings.
A flexible daily schedule was developed which included some 50 activi-ties
and special events.
One of the highlights of the F all program was the community Halloween
party. November 15th the recreation p rogram began its second season indoors
and many additional activities were added for both youth and adults. 76,605
participants attended the first .year of the Re creation Program which includes
December 1953 to November 1954. -••••;.,.._._
The Freeport Recreation Department is endeavoring to develop a pro-gram
that will serve the community needs. We feel that both girls and boys
should be given an opportunity to select constructive activities of their own
choice. . .

Vol.No.4-55 April, 1955
Whenever you drive, watch out for kids!
Kids often seerh to materialize out of thin air—
right in the motorist&#x27;s path.
Be on the alert for them as they speed along on bikes or roller skates
. . . as they dart out from behind parked cars . . . as they hesitate on
the curb, then plunge across the street. &#x27;
And be sure to watch for them at ALL crossings — marked or
unmarked.
J-&#x27;&quot;-&#x27; Even when you don&#x27;t see them, they may be dangerously, near. So
watch carefully for the tell tale signs that warn: &quot;Youngsters
Around&quot;—
Bikes, wagons, and other toys scattered about
Shouts and laughter of children at play
&quot;School Slow&quot; signs—permanent and&#x27; temporary
Playgrounds &quot;~f ^ &quot;[&#x27;&quot;••-
Parks &#x27; . &#x27; . - &#x27; • &#x27;
Each tell tale cautions—&quot;a little less speed . . . a little more alertness .
. . . a little more understanding of youthful impulsiveness.&quot;
Heed the tell tales. A bit of extra care on your part may mean the
difference between life and death for some youngster.
Children depend on YOU to protect them. Don&#x27;t fail them!

YOUR DOG
It&#x27;s Spring again and folks.are getting out in their gardens eager to get
the feel of the good earth once more -lawns are being raked, bulbs and seeds
are being planted, bushes are being trimmed and neighbors are seeing each
other for the first time since Winter took over and pushed everyone indoors.
It&#x27;s a grand and glorious feeling to get outdoors again, but like all oood things
there is always one hitch--P L E A S E--Curb your dog, and Don&#x27;t let them
run at large.

LIBRARY PROPOSITION DEFEATED
At the V illage election, the proposition to float a bond issue of $330, 000
to provide additional space and added facilities for the Memorial Library was
defeated by the vote of the property owners&#x27;of the Village. The vote by which
the taxpayers defeated the Library referendum was as follows: 779 - yea--
1143 - Nay. .
Several questions have come to the Village office as to the rights of cit-izens
to vote on bond issues. The law cites two qualifications for such voters:
(l)that they be regularly registered voters entitled to cast a ballot for public
officials, and (2) that they be owners of property in the Village assessed upon
the last preceding assessment roll.

AMENDMENTS TO VILLAGE ORDINANCES
Within the past month the Village Board has. adopted the following amend-ments
to the Freeport Unified Code-of Ordinances:
1. Rezoning for Business &quot;B&quot; use, four lots and part of another lot on
the east side of So. Bergen Place between Sunrise Highway and Pine Street.
These premises were formerly in the apartment house zone and their rezon-ing
now makes their development eligible for stores and shops for retail pur-poses,
with a limited use for manufacturing. It conforms the premises to the
zoning of other lots in the same block.
2. Amendment to the Plumbing Code simplifying administration and to
authorize the Building Superintendent to bring proceedings in cases of viola-tions.
. . .
3. Extending parkingmeter zone on MerrickRoad westtoBayviewAve. .
and on Newton Boulevard from Henry Street northeast to Sunrise Highway.
The details of these amendments may be secured at the Village office
by: those-interested.

NOTICE TO TREE PLANTERS
Residents who wish to plant trees between the sidewalk and curb should
make application to the Village office for a permit. This is primarily for the
purpose of saving home owners from future difficulties by ordinance, permit-ting
certain types of trees to be planted along the property edges. The reason
for this is thatvarious speciesof maple and other trees create difficulties with
sidewalks, adjacent lawns and drain pipes by unfavorable root developments.
These difficulties may be avoided by following the provisions set forth in the
Village Ordinance.
Upon application to the Village Clerk, full information will be provided.

HOUSING .REHABILITATION
Thomas Heffren, Rent Administrator for Nassau and Suffolk Counties in
a conference with Mayor Glacken and members of the Village Board of Trustees ,
arranged to inflict certain penalties upon landlords who fail to correct insani-tary
conditions and other violations of the Building Code upon order by the Vil-lage.
The penalty will be a revision in rents unless conditions and houses which
are substandard in nature are amended. Building Superintendent, Wilbert F.
DeMott, has been directed by Mayor Glacken to furnish the State Rent Com-mission
with complete details of uncorrected violations. In this way *he Vil-lage
Board hopes that unfavorable conditions will be corrected in all sections
before the end of the Summer.

COMPLAINT ABOUT DOGS
Mayor Glacken has received the following letter from a householder, Mr.
Charles H. Brass. This letter has so much common sense in it that it should
be read by all owners of dogs in our Village and that they take this publication
as an indication of how domestic pets should be handled in a community such as
ours. The letter reads as follows:
&quot;Dear Mayor Glacken:
This is to make you aware of the increasing bad situation brought
on by dogs being permitted to run around at large. The condition is bad not only
because of the depredation to gardens and newly made lawns but includes the
breeding of flies and other noxious in sects and holds latent danger to the spread-ing
of rabies.
&quot;I suggest that the law permitting a dog to have three bites be abolished
in our Village. I suggest further that the Village ordinance requiring that dogs .
be restrained on a leash not more than six feet be followed.&quot; This necessarily
imposes an obligation onresidents, but we cannot expect our police or the Town
dog catcher to trace every single dog who is on the loose to his own home. Any
amount of care to prevent this sort of business going on is better than to permit
danger to even one single child. We have recently been made aware of the need
to protect our children, and the fine work done by Dr. Salk and his associates
in helping abolish polio should be matched by our own care to protect children
against dangers which follow careless ownership of dogs.
&quot;I suggest that this le tter betaken as a warning to all dogownersand dog
lovers to keep their animals confined to prevent the spreading of flies and dis-ease
throughout the Village and to abate the danger of rabies.&quot;

LICENSES
Attention is called to the necessity of renewal of licenses as all Village
licenses expire May 1, 1955.

***************
VACANT LAND
Numerous complaints are received by the Village Clerk weekly regarding
dumping on vacant land -the debris being a fire hazard, and a health menace.
Inspection reveals conditions are frequently just as bad as has been reported.
The owner is contacted and requested to clear the land. Sometimes he com-plies;
sometimes he does not - placing his own complaint that the debris has
been dumped on his private land often by the very people who reported him to
the Village Clerk. It is to be admitted that usually what the Inspector finds is
garden clippings, tre^ branches, old lumber, vegetable peelings etc. or chil-dren
permitted to trespass on private property.
The Village Ordinance covering vacant land can be enforced at great ex-pense
but in tumour residents are earnestly requested to cooperate by placing
their garden clippings in tied bundles at the curb and calling the Highway Dept
to collect them.

Published monthly by the Village of Freeport

CLEAN-UP WEEK
By proclamation, Mayor William F. Glacken, has set the week of Mon-day,
June 13th to Saturday, June 18th, inclusive, as FREEPORT CLEAN-UP
WEEK. In carrying out the program as prepared by the Committee designated
by the Mayor, please observe the following suggestions.
IF YOU ARE A HOUSEHOLDER
Please dispose of all the accumulations of waste. Perhaps, your neigh-bors
have been careless and have thrown discarded newspapers, paper bags,
cellophane cigar wrappers, empty cigarette packages, bottles and other dis-carded
items along your hedges or sidewalks or on your lawns. On the back
of your lots, or in your garages or cellars or attics you have perhaps stored
away materials you intended to discard but have put off.
Village ordinances require the disposal of these various substances in
specific ways. These laws have been adopted to protect you and your neigh-borsfrom
injury by fire or otherwise, so please note that you may burn leaves,
paper and refuse along the curb in front of your premises but not within fifty
feet of any building,unless you procure a wire basket or other receptacle with
a tight cover to prevent the flying of ashes.
The law requires you tohelpkeep the roadway as well as your own premises
clean so it prohibits throwing your deposit of ashes, refuse, debris, grass
clippings, etc. either on the street or even on your own premises (where they
may become unsightly or dangerous) except in water tight covered containers
to be placed where they may be picked up by the sanitation trucks.
The law prohibits the accumulation of discarded lumber, dried weeds,
brush, waste paper, rags or other inflammable materials on your premises.
These accumulations may be disposed of by burning them but only if the burn-ing
is done in a metal receptacle or outdoor fire place, and insuch manner and
under such circumstances not to cause unreasonable annoyance to neighbors.
SANITATION PICK-UPS
The Sanitation Department in addition to its regular service during CLEAN-UP
WEEK will appear in your neighborhood as scheduled elsewhere in this bul-letin
to take away the surplus accumulations of waste materials. Smaller items
such as refuse, waste paper and the like must be put in a container or covered
can. Larger materials such as long stemmed weeds, brush, hedge clippings
and the like should be tied in convenient bundles with string to facilitate re-moval.
During CLEAN-UP WEEK such bundles may be placed for removal in
your neighborhood along the curb or sidewalk on the days scheduled.
To owners of vacant lots the law requires that such premises be kept in an
orderly and safe condition. During Clean-up week, please see to it that your
properties are thoroughly cleared of weeds, grass and refuse of every kind,
and the material placed in such position that the Sanitation Department may
make expeditious removal.
BUSINESS PREMISES
To owner s of bu sines s premise s, if you have previously n e glee ted to do so,
make sure that you gather together all rejected cartons, excelsior, paper and
other forms of waste. You should do this as a matter of regular routine, but
make a special effort during CLEAN-UP WEEK so that every one in the Village
may start off this Spring with record cleanliness and safety that will protect
the public and your own property from the hazards that come from carelessness
in this direction.

FREEPORT WATER SUPPLY
The Village Board and the Municipal Board of Water and L ight hereby ex-tend
their thanks for the patience and forbearance of the residents ofFreeport
who have so appreciated that the inconvenience caused by low water pressure
and discoloration of the water supply has been due to the necessity of cleaning
and painting the big million gallon tank on Sunrise Highway. The job has been
practically completed, fresh new pipes have been installed, the big tower paint-ed
inside and out and water service should resume its normal status within the
next few days. A similar job is still to be done on the Northeast water tower
but the difficulties attending that job will not be as great since it is only half
the size of the big tank on Sunrise Highway and pressure should be adequate
for all household purposes.
* * * * * * * * * * * ** * * *
DOG CATCHERS ON PATROL
It is said, there is nothing nicer than having a dog for a pet and it must be
true since our last dog census revealed a total of 2,613 dogs. Can you imagine
what the Village would be like if all 2,613 of these dogs were allowed to run
loose at one time? It seems fantastic and we know most people walk their dogs
and curb their dogs. Yet, our phones are kept busy with folks complaining
about dogs running loose. When these complaints are made, we have no choice
except to notify the dog catchers to pick up all stray dogs in accordance with
Village Ordinance.
If your are violating this ordinance and your pet is picked up one of these days,
please don&#x27;t be surprised as we are energetically enforcing the terms of the
ordinance. We urge you again and again to &quot;Walk and Curb Your Dog&quot;.

<dc:description>A LOOK BACK AT
FREEPORT
119 YEARS AGO
In 1836 Freeport was
known as Raynor South and
our neighboring village o f
Roosevelt was known as
Rum Point, (later changed
to Greenwich Point.) The
numeral 25 at the top of the
map shows Fulton Avenue,
Hempstead, (and its toll
gatejthen known as the South
Post Road. Just below it
the parallel road shown is
Jerusalem Avenue. The
road shown diagonally from
upper left to lower right is
Nassau Road as far as Rum
Point where it became Bab-ylon
Turnpike until itreach-edMerricks.
Bigars Creek
at the left is now Milburn
Creek, and the road to the
right of it is now known as
North Brookside Avenue.
The wavy line beginning
under the numeral 25 in the
center of the map was Old
Mill Road, which be«an at
Babylon Turnpike and Grand
Avenue, and ran down to
Merrick Road. When the L. I. Railroad was built the lower portion was aband-oned
and the upper portion is now Lakeview Avenue. The six dark spots, in the
center of the map a long E ast M eadow Creek are ponds which supplied water power
for the operation of paper mills. The paper, made of straw was used for wrap-ping
bundles. The big letters &quot;STEA&quot; are part of &quot;HEMPSTEAD&quot;, on the town-ship
map from which this section is reproduced.

PHOTO OF PUPILS OF SEAMAN AVENUE SCHOOL IN 1910
The Village has been loaned a photograph taken in 1910 showing about 200
pupils, between the ages of 6 and 12, in front of the Seaman Avenue School.
Those still alive would now be in their early or mid-50s. The photograph has
been reproduced and considerably enlarged so that the faces are more easily
identified. Anyone interested may see the picture at the Municipal Building
during regular business hours.

YEAR-ROUND CLEAN-UP TIME
Mayor Glacken, The Village Board and the Special Committee headed by •
Dr. M. G. Isenberg wish to tliank the people of Freeport for helping make a
success of Clean-up Week.
The ordinance designed to help Village Officials in providing for a clean
Village require that occupants of stores and houses prevent the accumulation
of brush, waste paper, rags, boxes and other inflammable material on the
premise. The purpose is to prevent fire by spontaneous combustion or care-lessness.
It is a violation of the ordinance to throw accumulations of debris, refuse,
leaves and similar materials in the streetunless it is put in water tight covered
containers to make possible its collection. A rubbish fire should also be kept
under strict control.
Toremind householder s of carelessness in failing to cooperate the Depart,
ment of Sanitation will leave a memorandum of which this is a copy. The Mayor,
Village Board and the Beautification Committee request your cooperation.

ALSO KEEP THE WATERS CLEAN
The Village Ordinance provides that no waste materials, ashes, garbage
or other offensive or rejected materials may be thrown into the waters within
the Village limits either from shore or from any craft. It has come to the at-tention
of the Board that newly arrived residents (perhaps under the assumption
that the ocean comes in and takes garbage away) throw lawn cuttings, shrub-bery,
rejected tin cans, hedge clippings and other and more offensive materials
overboard. Naturally, this contaminates the waters and makes bathing, fish-ing
and other sports impossible or disagreeable. Please cooperate!
LETTERS RECEIVED BY THE VILLAGE
Dear Mayor Glacken:
Recently my infant son w as in a state of convulsions due to pneumonia
and meningitis and only through the prompt arrival of Sgt. Grosser andPatrol-man
Ray Phillips with an oxygen inhalator, is my son alive today.
Patrolman Phillips stood in a very cramped position for over an hour
administering oxygen and accompanied the baby in the ambulance still admin-istering
oxygen to the hospital. He gave my son all the loving care that he
would have given his own child.
We certainly thank God we have such wonderful men in our Freeport
Police Dept.

Dear Mayor Glacken:
Very carelessly I threw $40.00 in with my garbage on Thursday night,
a fact I did not di scover until after the boys had been to the house. With the
help of a neighbor Mrs. Plant, we located the truck and explained the situa-tion.
Joe Alfano immediately said he would take the truck to the dump and
spread the load to look for the money. Mrs. Plant and I went to the dump and
helped go thru the garbage.
Finally after about 35 minutes, Mrs. Plant found the money.
I can&#x27;t thank the boys enough for their help and cooperation. The way
they looked, you would think they w ere looking for $40. 000 instead of $40. 00.
My grateful thanks to such a swell crew.

GRADE ELIMINATION NEARS FREEPORT
The New York State Department of Public Works has submitted to the
Board of -Trustees detailed outline of the section of the Long IslandRailroad
grade elimination which will be constructed in the immediate future. The de-tailed
outline provides for the relaying of the tracks as far as Bayview Avenue
and includes an elaborate system of drains to carry surface waters from the
north areas down Pennsylvania Avenue into culverts and westward to Mil burn
Creek. This is the first step toward Freeport&#x27;s participation in the grade elim-ination.
Mayor Glacken and the Board have been assured that designs for the
remainder of the Village are in process of completion so that work should begin
sometime within the next ten or twelve months.

RECREATION DEPARTMENT HAD A MOST ACTIVE SUMMER
The Village Recreation Department just completed its second full sum-mer
of operation. A comprehensive program was operated from June 27to
August 26, weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
and 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. at the Northeast, Northwest and Randall Parks
and in the morning at Holy Redeemer as an experimental playground from 9:00
a.m. to 12:00 noon. A well balanced activity program included a daily sched-ule
of arts and crafts, storytelling, group games, and a variety of athletic
activities. More than 700 craft items were made and a display was exhibited .
in the Village Hall. Square, folk and social dance instructions were given at
the various areas throughout the summer. Numerous tournaments were held ,
in ping pong, checkers, horseshoes, chess, newcombe and minature golf. Spe -
cial in structions were given in archery, tennis, golf, basketball and a four week
baseball clinic was conducted at Randall Park.
Swimming instructions for beginners were held each Tuesday and Thurs-day
at the Casino Pool. More than 75 children who were non-swimmers learn-ed
the basic fundamentals of swimming and many passed the beginners and in-termediate
Red Cross examination.
A bicycle safety rodeo was conducted at Randall Park in cooperation with
the Police Department and AllState Insurance Co. Another high light of the sum-mer
was the exciting B ottle Top Carnival at the Northeast Park where more than
500 youngsters participated. Numerous children constructed .and developed
their own booths for the car nival and it was most encouraging to-see the young-sters
display initiative and self reliance.
, More than 100 boys and girls became junior leaders during the summer
and greatly assisted the Re creation Department in the numerous daily activities.
A variety of interesting special events were conducted at all areas which
included suchfeatures as four pet shows, five doll shows, fourteen picnics and
cook-outs, three amateur shows, two costume shows, two field days, play-ground
festival, twelve feature movies, marshmellowroast, father and son ac- •
tivities, family nights, and many other attractions. Several teams were formed-in
Softball, basketball, volleyball, kick ball and newcombe and the youngsters
participated throughout the summer in inter-park competition.
Adult Activities Most Popular
A Recreation Department Adult Softball League was inaugurated at the
&#x27;Northwest Park under lights and played a series of 56 games in the eight team
Village League. A women&#x27;s team was organized and enjoyed competition with
neighboring communities.
Again this summer, a series of six outdoor family square dances, were
held in the Village Parks. Nearly 2,000 people, including children, parents
and grand parents enthusiastically enjoyed the wholesome dances. The Rec-reation
Department also provided an Adult Long Island Basketball Tournament
in which 14 top area teams participated. Adults also enjoyed the weekly golf
instructions at Randall and Northwest Parks.
All the Village Parks received exceptionally heavy use during the summer
with more than 70 different baseball and Softball teams participating in various
league competition. The picnic area at the Northeast Park served a large num-ber
of organizations and family outings. The Recreation Department aided the
Freeport Girl Scouts in developing a day camp at the Waterfront Park area.
Recreation Fall Activities begin September 19th
The Recreation Department will provide special leadership each weekday
afternoon from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. at Randall, Northwest and Northeast
Parks beginning Monday, September 19th. The program will feature many ath-letic
activities allowing youngsters to select the sport of their choice. Special
instructions will be given for girls and boys in archery, tennis, touch football,
basketball, hand ball, etc.
UNLAWFUL USE OF SIRENS
The Vehicle and Traffic Law of the State of New York, Section 81, Sub-division
18, in substance states that a gong, siren or whistle shall not be at-tached
to or used on any vehicle other than certain enumerated emergency ve-hicles.
Since bicycles under this law are classified as vehicles, but not asEMER-GENCY
vehicles, a siren attached to or used on a bicycle is a violation.
The Freeport P olice Department advises parents to instruct their children
to remove these sirens from their bicycles.

&quot;IS YOUR HOME WIRING ADEQUATE AND SAFE&quot;
The increased use of electricity in homes during the past ten years has
made the wiring systems in most older homes completely obsolete, andmany
new homes too, throughout the country, have been built with wiring that&#x27;s total-ly
inadequate for today&#x27;s electrical living.
Your home can not run efficiently and smoothly if--you risk a blown out
fuse whenever you use all the appliances and lights you need, or, the appliances
take forever to get hot, or, you have a maze of extension cords running hither
and yonder, or, your wiring system will not permit you to use certain impor-tant
appliances. This all adds up to a real hazard and-poor economy.
It&#x27;s often easy to bring a home wiring system up to date, some extra
outlets, another circuit or two or perhaps a larger main panel.
See your wiring contractor and have him check the wiring in your home
and learn what you need to bring it up to date for &quot;BETTER LIVING WITH
ELECTRICITY.&quot;
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
NEW TYPES OF ZONING PROPOSED FOR VILLAGE
The rapid developments of Freeport during the past several years as in-dicated
to the Civic Associations and the Boardof Trustees the need for provid-ing
new types of zone for the Village. Those most recently suggested were for-a
Marine Business District and Marine Industry District. The details of these-would
provide for Freeport the restricted areas similar in the general way to
Villages in the Cape Code area or the waterfront villages in Suffolk County, that
is business presumably in these areas would be confined largely to those having
to do with waterfront activities--fishing, boating and the like--so arranged if
possible as to provide harmonious and artistic background for the neighboring
residential areas. The details will be the subject of discussion at public meet-ing
held on Monday, September 12th, 1955.

<dc:description>MARINE BUSINESS &amp; MARINE INDUSTRIES DISTRICTS
In adoptingthe ordinance permitting the establishment of a &quot;Marine Bus-iness&quot;
district and a &quot;Marine Industries&quot; district, the V illage Board feels it
has taken a great step forward in the protection of Freeport&#x27;s greatest asset-its
water front.
At the present time, the only type of zoning applicable to the water front,
wherein are found boatyards, sales offices for boats, restaurants, marine
hardware stores, docks, fish markets, commercial fishing enterprises and
all the kindred waterfront activities, is &quot;Manufacturing&quot; or- &quot;Industrial,1.1
which, unfortunately, ne cessarily permits enterprises not connected with the
water front.
In adopting this ordinance, the Village Board has had in mind not only
the protection of enterprises that are already in existence, but establishing
firmly the rights of new marine industries to be established and, at the same
time, preserving and protecting the rights of residents who have chosen to
live near the water front from the annoyances of the usual enterprises inciden-tal
to a &quot;Manufacturing&quot; or &quot;Industrial&quot; district.

MURDER
Death grows bold as dusk de-scends.
Openly he stalks his
prey on streets and highways.
His victims are the careless and
unwary . . . those who carry
their daytime traffic habits over
into the twilight hours.
His weapons are the deceptive
shadows, reduced visibility, and
will o&#x27; the wisp reflections of the
night.
The peak hours for fatal traffic
accidents—especially during the
months of October through
March—are the early evening
hours from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.
October with its shortening days
by ffie CLOCK.
. . . . its change-over from day-light
saving to standard time . . .
ushers in the months of longer
darkness. It cautions less speed
and greater alertness during the
critical hours.
But the careless motorist drives
by the clock ... makes no allow-ance
for reduced visibility. Be-trayed
by his own out-moded
summer habits, he falls easily
into DEATH&#x27;S cunning trap.
The wise motorist drives by con-ditions—
NOT by the clock. He
reduces his speed and increases
his attention at the first hint of
darkness. He outwits the wily
DEATH.
Drive by CONDITIONS ...Not by the CLOCK
EARLY DAYS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
This company was organized in 1874, eighteen years before the village
was incorporated.
The earliest apparatus was pulled to fires by men graspinglong ropes.
This picture was taken about 1900. The white horses belonged to Mr. Henry
Schluter and were kept in his stable behind his grocery store thenlocated on the
south-east corner of Church Street and Merrick Road.
The firehouse was a very important building in the hi story of the village,
for it was the ONLY polling place in the village and it was within its walls that
the voters cast their ballots for every elective office.

SAFE DRIVING DAY
President Eisenhower, has proclaimed the nationwide observance of
Safe Driving Day on December 1st, 1955.
• The drive against traffic accidents in this country is not a new battle,
but over the years it has grown to such a size that it has now become a nation-al
issue. In this campaign for tr affic safety the necessity and effectiveness of
intensive public education in safety is no longer a debatable point; rather we
should like to think that the attrition of the traffic death rate over the years is
due in some &#x27;measure to the slow but certain effect of a public education pro7
gram which, through its many spirited leaders, has valiantly and persistently
attacked the problem of traffic safety. .
On S-D Day last year a comparison was made between the number of
accidents which bccured on that day with those on the same day of the previous
year. It was found that there was a reduction of 15 per cent in traffic deaths,
according to the President&#x27;s Committee for Traffic Safety.
If one day of safe driving and walking can produce such gratifying re-sults,
there is no doubt that a continuous day-by-day program would in time
make an appreciable reduction in the annual traffic toll in this country. Fur-thermore,
it would indicate that however you try to engineer, enforce, or argue,
safety—and all these approaches are necessary in the solution of the traffic
problem—down at the bottom, at the grass roots of. any mass movement, is the.
will and sense of personal responsibility of the individual.
. The problem of human safety in our traveled city arteries and on our
highways will be solved when each and everyone of us exercises this will to-ward
safety. .- . when we make every day Safe Driving Day.

LETTER OF COMMENDATION ON ACTIVITIES
Letter was received by the Freeport Police Department, from Mrs. J.
D. Chambers of 67 Grant St. commending them for their efforts in holding the
Bicycle Rodeo at Randall Park this past Summer. Mrs. Chambers felt this
was better than any other recreation offered a s it serves a twofold purpose,
since cycling is almost as important to children as walking. They begin to
learn this skill as toddlers and when they are older, to learn to do it well and
safely with the guidance of qualified people is well worth the time, effort and
expense. Having the police officers present at the contest made it doubly im-pressive
to the youngsters, and she was sure they willbeeven more enthusias-tic
next year. Mrs. Chambers wished to commend the Police Department for
their efforts in helping to teach the children to live a safe, .well-adjusted child-hood
in order that they may become grown citizens of which the Village may be
proud. .

Funds would go for architect&#x27;s plans and renderings, title searches,
surveys of the need for housing, test borings on the land--all the preliminary
development of the project, Baumann said.
The development plans resulting from this work must be submitted by .
July, 1956. If the PHA approves these plans, the money for construction of the
project will be forthcoming, Baumann believes. Baumann said he could not dis-close
the actual location of the site selected for the project.-
Freeport taxpayers voted the housing authority into existence in 1952
after a Newsday series on slum conditions in the Bennington Park area. The
authority submitted plans to the PHA in 1952 for a low cost housing project in
Bennington Park and was put on a list to get funds for construction.
But in 1953, Congress refused to pass a housing bill that would have made
these funds available, and the authority became temporarily inactive.
WhenCongress okayed a bill for 45, 000 housing units in the last session,
the Freeport authority applied for money for 100 units. Acceptance of this ap-plication
was formally received last week by the authority.

<dc:description>SAFE DRIVING DAY
As a result of the observance of SD-DAY on December 1st, 1955, at which
time Mayor Glacken on behalf of the Freeport Police Department, gave two
broadcasts over WGBB, on th e occasion of the proclamation by President Eisen-hower
to prove to each individual he can save lives and demonstrate that traffic
accidents can be reduced materially when all drivers and pedestrians fulfill
their moral obligations for safety. There were no reported accidents in the Vilr
lage of Freeport for the 24 hours of SD-Day.
The points brought out by the Mayor, in conjunction with the Freeport
Police Department—(1) to convince every ci tizen of the Village he has a moral
obligation to himself, his neighbors and community--(2) if every citizen knows
and abides by traffic laws and regulations--(3) &quot;Read andHeed&quot; the traffic signs,
signals and traffic markers on the highways, intersections and roads to pro-tect
li ves--(4)&quot;Stay Alert&quot; and expect the unexpected from motorists andpe-destrians--
proved if everyone takes upon himself the personal responsibility
for safety of all other individuals in the community, that many accidents can
be avoided. Freeport is proud of its good record for that day.

ADVANTAGES OF SUPPLEMENTARY ELECTRIC POWER
The relationship existing between the Long Island Lighting Co. and the
Municipal Power Plant was explained by Robert L. Doxsee, Chairman of the
Board of Water &amp; Light Commission and Village Clerk Milford F. Van Riper
at a recent meeting of the Southwest Civic Association. Allan Kellock and
Loren E. Hebl, two other commissioners also attended the meeting.
Mr. Doxsee gave three reasons for negotiating a contract with the Long
Island Lighting Company to supply current to augment that generated at the
Municipal Power House to assure a continuous supply of electricity for Free -
port consumers. (1) The rapid advancements in the improvement of generating
units indicate that the units purchased today are very likely to be obsolete five
years from now. (2) The unprecedented demand for residual fuels such as used
in our Diesel engines, is causing a price rise which can well make the operation
of diesel engines prohibitive in cost. (3) Practically all houses be ing built today
are 100% electrified which means the prime, obligation of public officials is to
see that adequate current is available at all times. The present hook-up en-abled
the Village to take care of essential services with either electricity pro-duced
in pur plant or in case of failure with that purchasedfrom the Lon^ Island
Lighting Co.
We are currently taking fr om the L. I. L. C. 5, 000 KW round the clock, this
is on a five year contract. We have the facilities for 5,000 additionalKW in the
event an emergency made it necessary to use an extra amount. The facilities
for the distribution of 10,000 KWhave been acquired at a cost less than half
the price of one diesel engine producing 3, 000 KW.
The Commission would be glad to appear before any organization or group
desiring further information about the distribution of its municipal electric
light plant.
Mr. Van Riper, who is executive secretary of the New York State Munici-pal
Electrical Utilities Association, prepared charts and graphs which showed
the tremendous increase since 1945 in the sales of electric energy; also set
forth the increase in fuel oil and labor costs and supplemented Mr. Doxsee&quot;s
remarks.

RECREATION DEPARTMENT NEWS
A community-wide meeting on Juvenile Delinquency was held January
25 at the Village Hall. Outstanding presentations were given by Judge Paul
Kelly, Police Justice; Sidney Lutzin of the New YorkState Y outh Commission
and Dr. Max Wolff professor of sociology at New York University. Following
the panel, representatives from some 35 local organizations and interested
citizens participated in a lively discussion. Judge Kelly spoke on the legal
aspect of the Juvenile Delinquent and explained the proceedure of correction,
and rehabilitation. Dr. Wolff emphasized the value of participation and the
importance for youth to be given the opportunity to accept responsibility. Sid-ney
Lutzin, an official of the New York State Youth Commission, said that
every community is plagued with the problem of Juvenile Delinquency and it
is important for each village to work together in order to prevent Delinquency.
He stressed the importance of a year-round community recreatin program.
He also stated that affection, understanding and recognition by parents would
do much to combat Delinquency. In this discussion, it was suggested that the
schools, churches, Village Officials and existing youth agencies would work
together in preventing Delinquency before it becomes a problem in Freeport.
WGBB broadcast the Public Meeting and Mr. David Kadane, Park Commission
Chairman, acted as moderator.
The Recreation Department has completed its annual report covering
the second year of operation, and you may obtain it by telephoning or calling
at the Recreation Office in the Village Hall.

of activities being held daily in all sections of the community. With the addi-tion
of the new Women&#x27;s Basketball League, the Recreation Department now
has organized 29 teams that are participating in league competition. Interest-ed
parents and citizens are cordially invited to visit any of the youth or adult
recreation activities.

CLEAN-UP CAMPAIGN
Last year the Village of F reeport sponsored a &quot;CLEAN-UP, PAINT -
UP, FIX-UP week in an effort to tidy up the community at large and engender
a spirit of civic pride in the appearance of our home surrounding. It was quite
successful.
A community the size of Freeport does not retain the appearance of a
&quot;Front Parlor&quot; without year round application and a genuine desire on the part
of its citizens to keep it so.
Further, a community kept free of litter and debris is more attractive
to potential property owners as well as enhancing the value of real property.
In last year&#x27;s initial campaign, other than an appeal for cooperation,
no steps were taken to enforce compliance with the spirit of the drive.
The Village is well supplied by statute with means of forcing its tax
payers to keep their property within the bounds of the requirements of normal
health standards and it is this aspect of the campaign which will be emphasized
this year.
The &quot;CLEAN-UP&quot; Campaign will begin on Monday, April 23rd and the
following schedule of collections will be used by the Sanitation Department:

new 24 inch water main for this area. This main is being installed to increase
the supply and pressure of water for the entire southern area of the Village.
It is expected that this work will be completed within the next three months.
STREET LIGHTING
It is contemplated that the new Mercury lighting system being install-ed
on Merrick Road from the westerly boundary of the Village to Main Street

SIGNS OF LIFE
All of us in the ordinary course of human life are heavily dependent up-on
signs of one kind or another to guide us. In the human organism pain is al-ways
the infallible sign of something wrong;the weatherman reads and inter-prets
the language of clouds, winds, and atmospheric pressure in predicting
the forthcoming weather events; the businessman reads the ticker tape for signs
of stock market fluctuations, the sailor reads the stars for direction and
the man in the street moves safely through our complex traffic guided bytraf-fic
signs and signals.

This picture, taken in 1893, shows the exercises of breaking groundfor
a ten room school to accommodate 500 pupils, at a cost of $30,000. In 1904 it

CHILD PEDESTRIAN SAFETY
Each year thousands of our children and young
people fall victim to traffic accidents. Some
are killed outright, others suffer injuries that
maim them for life.
While traffic accidents in themselves are fright-ening
and hideous -- a bane to our social wel —
fare and progress --the number of young people
sacrificed to this monster each year on our
streets and highways is particularly heinous.
THE SOLUTION
The ultimate solution of the problem of child
pedestrian safety rests with the combined ef-forts
of parents, motorists, and children them-selves
in improved safety practices and alert-ness
.in. tr affic. -Cooperation between parents
and schools ifl especially important in coordin-ating
the training of children in tr affic safety
education. Motorists, too, should be alerted
to the problem of child safety and made aware
of the need for more cautious driving -habits,
particularly in school zones and in areas w here
children congregate.
&quot;WATCH OUT WHEN KIDS ARE OUT!&quot;

STREET LIGHTING
At a recent meeting of the Board of Trustees funds were provided for
Mercury Street Lights, similar to those on Main Street, Merrick Road and on
Sunrise Highway east of GroveStreet, to be installed on Sunrise Highway from
Grove Street West to the Baldwin Line. This is a much needed improvement
and we are sure that everybody will be more than pleased and happly with the
new lights.

With the&#x27;many miles of streets and the heavy traffic thereon, the

SLOW DOWN AT NIGHT
More than half of all traffic deaths happen at night, even though
a lot less driving is done at night than during the d^y.
In an average year, the National Safety Council estimates that
the mileage death rate is two to three times as great at night as in day-light
hours.
The reasons should be apparent to everyone.
You can&#x27;t see as well at night, and you must see danger to avoid
it.
Drivers try to maintain daytime speeds, yet even the best head-lights
illuminate only a fraction of daylight seeing distance.
Night driving is more likely to result in fatigue, sleepiness and
dulled alertness.
And night is the time for sociability which often means driving
after drinking.
So drive right and slow down at night. Figure the heavy odds
against you and don&#x27;t gamble with your own life or the lives of others
who share the road with you, trusting in your common sense.
It does&#x27;t take brains or skill to send an automobile hurtling through
a tunnel of blackness. It does take brains to soberly count the hazards
beyond the probing finge rs of the headlight beam, and skill to be ready
and under control for the emergency which rr-.-uy loom at any moment.
The Freeport Police Department urges all pedestrains to be ex-tra
careful of traffic between five and eight at night. And motorists -
drive right

The purpose of the program is to reduce the hazards of bicycle
riding for both young riders and others, by training our boys and girls
in riding skills, and in the observance of safety rules.
Increasing congestion of our streets and highways daily increases
the hazards for the careless or unskilled. Hundreds of death and thou-sands
of non-fatal injuries each year, due to collision between bicycles
and motor vehicles, alone, warn .of the need of such a program.
In particular, I call for the support of parents and their children
who ride bicycles. I urge that parents encourage their children to par-ticipate
in the program and I urge that children obey the rules of safety
on the road.

FIRST UNITED FUND CAMPAIGN IN FREEPORT
EXCEEDS GOAL
RAISES OVER $37,500 QUOTA WAS $35, 000
The first United Fund of Freeport Campaign held duringOctober
has raised over $37, 500 to date. This announcement was made recently
by Fund President Dr. Milton B. Waldman.
Final figures on the campaign will not be available for several
weeks, but the original goal has already been exceeded by over $2, 500.
In speaking of the outstanding success of the first campaign for 7 partic-ipating
agencies, Dr. Waldman described it as one of the most success-ful
community endeavor s in which Freeport has participated. He further
pointed out that the citizens of Freeport can be proud of their record of
achievement in supporting this community-wide effort.
In analyzing the results of the drive United Fund Officials attrib-uted
its success to several factors. &quot;Freeport has accepted the prin-ciple
of United Giving as a means for community support of health, wel-fare,
service and philanthropic groups. In addition, the enthusiasmand
support of hundreds of volunteer workers rolled up a magnificent result
in the village house-to-house canvass.
Proceeds of the campaign will be distributed to participating
groups early in 1957. Organizations to share in this distribution are:
American Red Cross, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Cerebral Palsy, Mental
Health Association, Salvation Army, and U.S.O. It was also pointed
out by Russell E. Hotaling, Campaign Manager, that none of these 7
agencies will conduct any house to house appeals for funds during 1957.
Already both the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts have announced plans
for their 1957 Fund campaigns elsewhere, but in both cases it should
be noted that the village of Freeport will not be included, because of the
participation of both of these agencies in the United Fund Campaign for
1956, which has provided them with this village&#x27;s share of their 1957
requirements.

• &quot; PEDESTRIAN SAFETY
Good, safe pedestrians are not born, but made--and they are made
through education in the basics of safe walking and proper procedures
for surviving in our present-day motorized civilization. People must be
alerted to the necessity for practicing good safety habits in their daily
lives, especially in their
walking habits on- our
StreetSo They must be a-ware
that they have an e-qual
challenge to assure
their own protection by
crossing streets safely as
the motorist has by driv-ing

BACK THE ATTACK ON TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS
During 1957 the national effort to step up the whole traffic safety
program is under the banner - &quot;Back the Attack on Traffic Accidents&quot; -
and during the Summer quarter (June, July and August) the theme is -
Slow Down and Live - Share the Road. Emphasis is on individual and
official activity in the Speed Control, Vacation Driving and Share the
Road monthly programs. We will Back the Attack on Traffic Accidents
this summer by driving at safe speeds, taking proper precautions on
vacation trips and keeping in step with traffic as we &quot;Share the Road.&quot;
These are the individual actions we must take.
We must also give our support to the increasing official efforts to
control traffic accidents. This means backing stronger enforcement on
the part of all police agencies and traffic courts and supporting licens-ing
and inspectionauthorities and other motor vehicle and highwayagen-cies
in their efforts to move traffic efficiently and safely.
Mayor William F. Glacken

COMPLIMENTARY LETTER
Dear Sirs:
Being in the Navy and having lived in numerous communities,
it is a pleasure to find a forward looking Water Department. To be able
to use as much water as one desires, while other Villages have water
hours or some other limitation, should certainly be a. matter of pride
within the Village of Freeport.
Each green lawn in the area reflects work on the part of the
homeowner but would not be possible without an efficient Water Dept.
Your water rates are so low that I feel I have received a bar-gain
each time the water statement is presented.
Thank you for your Efforts

every man, woman, and child will be fully protected. Well and Good!
But what about another problem closer to home and perhaps just
as important--the safety of our children? Granted we need protection
from the skies, but do we not also need protection from the dangers that
lurk on our streets, on our highways, and even in our own homes?
Statistics will tell you how many children die each year under
the wheels of motor vehicles or in fires or in the freak accidents that
happen every day, but they cannot begin to convey the heartbreak and the
shameful waste of human life that lie behind these cold figures.
PARENTS-Teach your children the dangers of mid -block cross-
KEEP YOUR EYE on all SMALL FRY.

WOODCLEFT AVENUE WIDENING
The Board of Trustees is considering a much needed improve-ment
for the waterfront area. The widening of Woodcleft Avenue from
Front Street south to Richmond Street can be completed within a short
time if the property owners on the west side of Woodcleft Avenue will
cooperate with the Village by dedicating approximately ten (10) feet of
their property. Because of the depth of the lots on the east side of Wood-cleft
Avenue, it would not be practical to take any of this for the widen-ing.

WATER DEPARTMENT REPORT
In July of 1954 it was my privilege to recommend to a joint meet-ing
of the Village Board and the Water and Light Commission a major
expansion of our water system both as to production and distribution.
Following the unanimous approval of the Board and of the Commission
and later by the village engineer, the Board made available $650, 000
to finance the cost.
The new facilities have been given a rough test during the past
three months. This area has just passed through the driest season in
the history of the Weather Bureau, but the citizens of Freeport have en-joyed
without interruption a normal supply of water for all purposes,
with no restrictions as to its use, either as to time or quantity.
In meeting this demand the system exceeded all records. A new
daily pumping record of nearly 7, 000, 000 gallons was set as compared
to the old record of 5,500,.000 gallons. A new monthly pumping record
of 153, 000, 000 gallons was set as compared to the old record of 124,
000, 000 gallons. The average for the month of July was 5, 000, 000 gal-lons
per day as compared to the old record of 4, 000, 000 gallons per
day, an increase of 1, 000, 000 gallons per day. The two new wells have
met all requirements, both being first class producers.
It would have been utterly impossible to have supplied the citizens
of our village with the necessary water to meet the current demands if
the Board and Commission had not made it possible to expand the sys-tem
by drilling the two new wells and installing the large mains to con-vey
the water throughout the village as required. The residents of Free-port
surely must greatly appreciate what the present regime have done
for them in this respect.

UNITED FUND CAMPAIGN
Freeport&#x27;s second annual United Fund campaign willbe held dur-ing
October. Residents of the Village showed by their support of the
first campaign last year that they liked the United way of giving. The
United Fund saves time, effort and money for those who give, for the
member agencies of the Fund, and for those who volunteer their aid in
collecting.
This year eight community service organizations will be repre-sented
by the Fund. Seven were in the campaign last year; they are the
Salvation Army, Red Cross, Cerebral Palsy, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts,
Mental Health Association and USO. A new worthy member of the Fund
this year is the Association for the Help of Retarded Children.
Total quota of the second campaign, which will provide 1958 funds
for the agencies, is $37,200. This is an increase of $2, 200 over last
year. Facts about the member agencies and their individual quotas are
contained in a special brochure being mailed to all Village residents by
the Fund.
Mayor William Glacken is Honorary Chairman of the campaign
and Village residents are making house-to-house calls on behalf of the
Fund. When your neighbor comes to collect, remember that your single
contribution will work all year for eight agencies. This is your United
Fund - Be Generous.

Mr. Stephen A. Coffey, Superintendent of Public Works,, wishes
to call to the attention of the owners arid/or occupants of- property&quot;in

The above is a picture of the A splundh Chipper, the newest piece
of Equipment purchased by the Village of Freeport for the Light De-partment,
to be used in the tree trimming program.
The chipper, chips up trees, branches, brush, etc. on the spot
and loads it into the truck. With Christmas tree time nearing, it will
solve the disposal problem by a 75% savings in time over old methods,
because one truckload of chips equals four truckloads of brush, branches,
and trees.
(con&#x27;t. on page two)
From the standpoint of the brush itself, it is difficult and haz-ardous
to load, at the dump it is hard to handle, creates a fire potential,
and provides a breeding place for rodents. All of this is eliminated by
using the Asplundh Chipper.
The wood chips serve many useful purposes as mulch, etc.

<dc:description>FREE FIREPLACE LOGS
The Village is offering to the residents of Freeport, without
charge, fireplace logs cut from trees which have to be removed for
various reasons. The logs will be stacked at the North-West corner of
Brooklyn Avenue and North Grove Street.
Due to the fact that tree removal is not a continuous operation
the supply of logs will necessarily fluctuate. However, in the future
all logs cut by the Tree Crew and the Highway Department will be made
available to the residents, courtesy of the Village of Freeport.

NOTICE TO VILLAGE TAXPAYERS
The Village Treasurer advises all taxpayers to make sure their
taxes are paid, as he will have to sell all unpaid taxes on January 28,
1958.
NOTICE TO PARENTS
It has beenbr ought to the attention of the Village Board that forty
(40) lights have been stolen from the Christmas tree at the railroad sta-tion;
also that a cedar tree in the Municipal Park facing BrooklynAve.
had been mutilated to the extent that it must be removed. This is ap-parently
the work of youngsters and it is suggested that all parents en-deavor
to impress upon their young people that public property is also
their property and when it is destroyed it reflects on the over -all cost
of operating the community.
At this time it might also be mentioned that many street lights
are wantonly destroyed by throwing of stones, sling -shots, etc. This
costs the electric light department many hundreds of dollars through-out
the year, which is a direct loss to the community at large. It would
be nice if children could be taught that public property is their property
and whenever they see it being destroyed, if they would tell their parents
and the parents in turn inform the Village Clerk, a great public service
would be rendered.

April 5th, 1958
The Freeport Recreation Department with the cooperation of
many service groups and business organizations will again hold two
separate Easter Egg Hunts on Saturday, April 5th, beginning at 1:30
P. M. sharp at the Northeast Park, the scene of the second hunt will be
at the Northwest Park and will start promptly at 3:00 P. M.
More than 6, 000 candy eggs will be wrapped and hidden through-out
the two parks prior to the hunt. Chocolate Easter bunnies will be
awarded to the children in each age group who find the &quot;Golden Egg&quot; or
the &quot;Lucky Numbered&quot; eggs.
Each Easter Egg Hunt will be divided into two major groups -
boys and girls 10 years of age and younger and children 7 years of age
and under. Recreation Superintendent, Kent G. Thomson would like to
ask the parents of the smaller children to accompany their youngsters.
Donations by service and civic organizations will again finance
the purchase of the candy eggs and the chocolate bunnies for this com-munity
wide event. In case of inclement weather, the huntwill be sched-uled
for the following Monday at the same time and at the same places.
TEEN-AGERS ATTENTION:
The FreeportRecreation Department&#x27;s Jr. Council has purchas-ed
SOticketsfor the College All Star -HarlemGlobe Trotter s Game which

SNOW REMOVAL
Village forces clear Village Streets, Parking Lots and Village
owned areas. Within the Village are both State and County Highways
which are not the obligation of the Village of Freeport Highway Division.
Parked vehicles in the road are a severe handicap in removing
snow back to the curb line which is the water flow line to drainage basins.
It is the intention of the Department of PublicWorks to make our
Village Streets passable and safe for fire equipment, ambulances and
normal vehicular traffic. It is requested that cars be removed from
public areas that a better job may result.

The Village Treasurer presents Trustee Lang with the first light
bill from the Village&#x27;s new I. B. M. Machines. The Village is very
proud of its I. B. M. Machines, as it is the first Village on Long Island
to go into this modern machinery.
The accurate, fast computations made by these machines will
make it possible to keep abreast of any and all increases in the popu-lation
of the Village for many years to come.

WATER DEPARTMENT NEWS
The Nassau County Health Department ordered the village water
system chlorinated Feb. 3rd due to possible contamination as an after
result of the Shore Crest Fire. Laboratory samples taken last week
proved O.K. and chlorination was stopped Feb. 10th. Citizens may now
again enjoy Freeport&#x27;s usual excellent water without any objectionable
odor of chlorine.
Bids were opened Feb. 17th for the construction of a 12&quot; water main
in So. Main Street leading into the Bay Estates area. This will give
the residents two sources of water supply and also anticipates the con-struction
of a large number of new homes further south. The Village
Board required this work done previous to paving the various streets in
the Bay Estates area this spring. Included in the contractfor new water
mains are those for several streets in the Woodcleft area which will
improve the service for that area.
The Water Department reports a pumpage of 1,085,843,331 gallonsof
water for the year of 1957. This is an all time record. It reflects the
quantity of water now available due to the increase of new wells and
new transmission mains, also the Boards action in giving Freeport re-sidents
the privilege of using water as needed with no restrictions as to
time.
LETTER RECEIVED
Dear Mr. Crevoiserat:
I hereby register our thanks from the heart, for the pleasure
we had this past summer with the plentiful supply of .water for sprink-ling
our large lawn and shrubs, otherwise, we could have lost heavily
on a substantial investment. We do appreciate sincerely what your De-partment
has done for us.

<dc:description>POINTERS ON THE POINT SYSTEM
The Motor Vehicle Bureau&#x27;s newly revised Point System to keep
score on the records of all licensed drivers will go into effect April 1,
1958.
Mandatory Revocations
There are a number of situations in which the Commissioner of
Motor Vehicles is required by law to revoke your license. Among these
are the following:
1. Three speeding violations or any three misdemeanors (including
reckless driving), or any combination of these, in 18 months.
2. Driving while intoxicated in this State or under the influence of
intoxicating liquor outside the State.
3. Refusal to submit to a chemical test for intoxication under pre-scribed
conditions.
4. Criminal negligence resulting in death, whether the conviction
was had in this state or elsewhere.
5. Leaving the scene of an accident.
6. False statement in application for license or registration or sub-stitution
in examination.
7. Homicide or assault arising out of the operation of a motor ve-hicle
or motorcycle.
8. Driving or permitting the operation of an uninsured motor ve-hicle.
(One-year revocation.)
After April 1, 1958 if you accumulate eight points within two years,
ten points within three years, or 12 points within four years, you will
be summoned for a hearing which may result in revocation or suspen-sion
of your license as a persistent violator.
Following are the number of points to be charged against your
record for certain offenses starting April 1, 1958.
3-- Three Points--Speeding, reckless driving or dangerous driving.
2-- Two Points --Passing stopped school bus, passing red light, fail-ing
to stop at &quot;Stop&quot; sign, failing to yield right of way, making U-turn
on hill or curve, inadequate brakes, driving uninspected car, failing to
signal or crossing double line.
1 1/2 One and a Half Points--Failing to dim headlights, insufficent
lights, no horn or driving too slow.
1-- One Point--Improper plates, improper turn, unauthorized red
or blue light, inadequate reflectors, inadequate muffler, unnecessary
noise or smoke, dazzling lights or failure to notify bureau of change of
address.
This is not the complete list, but it gives you an idea of what
happens when you violate traffic laws.
Revocation or suspension does not depend solely on the number
of points accumulated. Each case is decided on its own merits after
the driver has had a chance to be heard.

of the new fire alarm system.
Two hundred of these radio type receivers will be placed in the

to fire alarms and will contribute to a much safer community, Chief
Barrett stated.
The new system will also eliminate local sirens and whistles
with the exception of the whistle at the power house and sirens on the

The radio receivers will operate from an auxiliary transmitter
in police headquarters. The system will enable the desk sergeant to

FILLING THEM UP!
The filling ofHansePark, a seven (7) acre site formerly seven
to ten feet below road grade is near ing completion and is already being
exploited. Construction operations for industrial plants have already
commenced on S. Main Street south of Smith Street.and Adjoining the
Hanse Park Area. These plants will border on the Henry Street extension
scheduled on the completion of the E. Merrick Widening.
The administration has secured at no cost easement rights for
parking purposes from the Town of Hempstead on approximately four
acres of property located on the south side of Mill Road west of Freeport
Stadium. This sub-marginal landwhich is a swamp area is currently
being filled in with rough fill being secured from the R.R.Grade Elim-ination
program and the E. Merrick Road widening. Not only will the
area be improved esthetically but the parking facilities for Freeport&#x27;s
Municipal Stadium will be greatly increased. This area is also seven
feet below road grade and it is estimated that it will require 100 thou-sand
yards of fill to complete the project.

The County of Nassau is receiving bids for the construction of
a park similar to Silver Lake Park in Baldwin on ten acres of proper-ty
adjoining the new high school side and fronting on W. Merrick Road
on August 15, 1958. This park will tie-in to the High SchoolGrounds
giving the effect of a beautiful campus and thus giving to Free port two
beautiful entrances on its westerly extremity i. e. , from Sunrise High-way
and from W. Merrick Road. A further embellishment will be a
graceful waterfall at the southern end of the reduced pond. This long
sought project is a cog of the present administrations*s program.

MAYOR GLACKEN SAYS SLUMS MUST GO!
Village issuing notices to Landlords in Violation
Determined to speed Freeport&#x27;s Slum Clearance and Rehabili-tation
program as rapidly as possible. Mayor Wm.F. Glacken announc-ed
that the Village of Freeport is beginning to serve notices of viola-tions
on property owners who fail to meet the standards of building
code and rehabilitation ordinances.
&quot;We have embarked upon a program to eliminate the slums of
the Village of Freeport, demolish unsalvagable eyesores, and enforce
the rehabilitation of substandard properties that do not come up to the
standards of our building code and rooming house ordinances, Mayor
Glacken said, &quot;landlords who have been found in violation of the stand-ards
set by law are beginning to get notices that they must comply or
pay the penalty. &quot;
. Relocation facilities for families of low income now occupying
substandard housing in Freeport will very shortly be available in the
new low-income Public Housing Project, GARDEN COURT APART -
MEMTS, wMcfa is approaching completion in the southeast section of the
Village, Mayor Glacken pointed out. He explained that under the terns
of the contract which the Freeport Housing Authority has with the Put
lie Homsing Administration, and the cooperation agreement which the
Authority has with the Village Government, one substandard dwelling
must be eliminated for each of the 100 new apartments in the public
housing development now under construction.
&quot;We are thus assured, through enforcement of our local ordi-nances
and provision of decent shelter for eligible low-income families

Gentlemen:
I thought you might be interested to know that last Friday night,
August 8, we had one of those heavy rain storms, right after we opened

Our rent for that show was $1, 148. 01 and Sport Services&#x27;s rent
was $627. 00 totaling $1, 775. 00 for the Village of Freeport.

F. Glacken inspecting location of Henry Street extension

The county is soon to start these projects in the Village
of Freeport.
*****
On Friday, September 26th, County Executive, A. Holly Pat-terson,
in response to Mayor William F. Glacken&#x27;s invitation, visit-ed
Freeport and personally inspected completed Nassau County pro-jects
such as the East Merrick Road widening and the Milburn Pond
culvert. Also visited were the sites for planned projects such as the
new West Merrick Road Park at Milburn Pond, the area for the ex-tension
of Henry Street to Mill Road and the Northeast area where a
$900, 000 drainage project will be undertaken.
Mr. Patterson&#x27;s willingness to install a 24 ft. concrete cul-vert
through the Milburn Pond made this site available for the new
high school and saved the tax-payers of School District #9 countless
of hundreds of thousands of dollars in land acquisition costs plus the
taxes on twenty other acres of property that necessarily would have
been condemned. His foresight in developing for park purposes, the
land south of the school site will result in a &quot;campus-like&quot; effect and
esthetically Freeport gains two beautiful entrances on its westerly
borders. The cost of this project is in excess of $200, 000.
A quick review of the cost of all of these public improvements
that have been secured by&#x27;your administration from the present Coun-ty
goverment would give a sum total in excess of THREE MILLION
DOLLARS. This has been made possible mainly through the recep-tivesness
of the County Executive to the Village Board&#x27;s request. Mr.
Patterson has a complete grasp of the community&#x27;s development prob-lems
and his cooperation in helping to solve these very problems is
most gratifying and sincerely appreciated.

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
When you talk to Robert E. Patter-son,
former Mayor of Freeport (1933-
41), you might expect someone who
would dwell in the past for Bob has
been in the Long Island real estate
business since 1903, and a resident of
Freeport since 1925. But Bob&#x27;s
ideas are all on the future of Freeport*
Bob, who was Mayor during the
grim depression years looks back on
that eight year period as one of the
high points in his life. &quot;It was an ed-ucation,
&quot;he says, &quot;that money could
not buy anywhere. &quot; Bob also served
as trustee in 1931-33; served 12 years
on the County Board of Assessors and
was one of the original members of
the Planning Board on which he is now
serving his 23rd year.
Although born in Manhattan and
living for 30 years inGreenpoint,
to Bob Patterson Freeport is home.
He and Mrs. Patterson, the former
Frances M. Grimm, live on Souths ide Avenue and Bob still conducts
his real estate appraisal business at 53 So. Grove, with 55 years
in the real estate business and almost as many in the service
port, Bob is looking forward to the next 50 which he feels look
promising for the future of Freeport.

KEEP STREET CLEAR FOR VILLAGE SNOW PLOWS
As has been our custom, in the event of snow, the Public Works
Dep&#x27;t. will work around the clock until the job is completed. It is
urged that Village of Freeport residents do not leave their cars on the
street overnight during the next four months in order to facilitate snow
removal operations. By parking their cars in garage or driveway,
they will avoid having them buried in snow and assist the run-off at the
curb line.
With this winter expected to bring one of the heaviest snowfalls
in recent years, the Village Highway Dep&#x27;t. requests the homeowners&#x27;
cooperation in helping to keep open the 120 miles of Village Highways.

Theodore R. Combs
Supt. of Parks &amp; Stadium
KNOW YOUR VILLAGE DEPARTMENT HEADS
Theodore R. Combs must like
Freeportfor he wasbornhere in 1900
and still lives a quarter-mile fromhis
birthplace. Ted was born on a large
farm which stood where dozens of
houses now stand on South Bay view.
Apparently the only time he left Free-port
was to court Sadie Beere of Ocean-side
and bring her back to Freeport
as Mrs. Combs.
Ted has served the Freeport Park
Dep&#x27;t. for 22 years, 15 of them as
Supt. of Parks &amp; Stadium. He really
has his hands full. He supervises 5
parks and the stadium and during the
•winter his big job is keeping the 3
ponds frozen for skating despite un-predictable
warm spells. Ted recalls
when the Brooklyn Dodgers football
teams trained in Freeport Stadium
in the late Thirties and when the pro
Chicago Rockets.played the New York
Yankee football team in 1948.
But that is not Ted&#x27;s biggest thrill in his job. A product of Free-port
schools himself, he enjoys seeing the second generation of Free -
port kids playing ball in the same stadium that their dads played not
too many years ago. Probably Ted&#x27;s next biggest thrill is his 38 year
connection with the Village Fire Dep&#x27;t. , or perhaps it&#x27;s his 3 children
and 7 grandchildren. Be that as it may, one thing is certain--there&#x27;s
no chance that Mr. and Mrs. Ted Combs will ever be moving out of
Freeport.

ICE SKATING AT RANDALL PARK
The Village Recreation Dep&#x27;t. will provide supervised ice skating

If you wanted to contact F. Gordon
Edwards any time during the past 39
years, it would have been easy--he&#x27;s
lived at the same address 104 Southside
Avenue all of that time. But chances are
he -wouldn&#x27;t have been home. Gordon
supervised telephone systems all over
Long Island, Queens and Brooklyn during
those years for N. Y. Telephone Company
and even spent 2 years in Indonesia ad-vising
the government on their telephone
systems. He retired from the phone
company in 1953.
Busy or not, Gordon always had
time for community service. He was
-member of-the-Zoning Board-of-Appeals
from 1944 to 1953 and chairman of that
group from 1948 to 1953. He became a
member of the Water and Light com-mission
in 1956 and its chairman just
last summer. He&#x27;s also District Governor F.Gordon Edwards
of the Rotary Club Supervising 56 clubs Chrmn. Light &amp; Water Comm,
on Long Island. ~~~~~^
Gordon&#x27;s main interest these days is Freeport. Mrs. Edwards,
the former Daisie Jones of Patchogue, and Gordon have four children
who were educated inFreeport schools and seven grandchildren. Per-haps
it should be said their main interest these days are Freeport and
the grandchildren, although Gordon still gets a funny look in his eye
every time he sees a telephone.

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
Kids, flowers, do -at -your self,
are all big hobbies with Edward M.
Voelker but they take a not-so-close
second Lplace to his service to the
community of Freeport. Ed is Chair-man
of the Sewer Commission and a
Freeport resident since 1937whenhe
married Ruth Marshall, a Freeport
High School math, teacher. Ed, born
in Pennsylvania, received his ele-mentary
education in Canada and stud-ied
architecture at Columbia Univer-sity.
He became interested in san-itary
engineering and after twenty
years as chief engineer of a corpora-tion
designing equipment, to eliminate
air and stream pollution, he formed
his own company specializing in the
design and construction of incinera-tors.
Eight years ago, when a va-cancy
occured on the Sewer Commis-sion,
he was the logical choice. Three
years later he was appointed chairman of the commission.
With Ed on the Sewer Commission, he helped steer the Village
through a vast sewer construction program. Sewers Have been installed
in most parts of the Village, together with the necessary pumping sta-tions
for the southerly part of Freeport. The first stage of improving
and enlarging the Village Sewage Treatment Plant was completed in
1956. Several years ago he-alerted the Village Board to the possibil-ity
of Federal aid for the completion of the second stage. Negotiations
resulted in the Village receiving a Federal grant of $250, 000 and the
second and final stage of the Sewage Treatment plant improvements
will be under construction this spring at an estimated cost of slightly
under $1, 000, 000.
Ruth and Ed have lived at 446 Ray Street since 1940 and this
year they are the president-couple of the Jr. Sr. High School P. T.A.
They have two children, Eddie who is a Junior and Martha Jane who
graduated from Freeport High in 1957.
Dr. Harry Loonier has on exhibition interesting bird pictures
in the Freeport Memorial Library. The Doctor creates these unusual
pictures now on display. For those interested persons who have the
patience and feeling for good composition, Dr. Loomer has consented
co share his knowledge and technique Mon. , Thurs. ,Fri. , evenings,
thru March. *******

Leonard D. B. Smith
Treasurer &amp; Assessor-&#x27;
Community service is some-thing
in the nature of a tradition in
the Smith Family. Leonard D. B.
Smith, Treasurer and Assessor for
the Village of Freeport (two jobs
but one salary) often recalls his
father Dimon Smith who served for
14 years as Village Treasurer and
16 years as County Assessor.
Len was born in Freeport in
1906, went through the Freeport
school system, captained the Free-port
High Football team in 1924 and
took a trip into Manhattan to meet
Catherine Kellett and bring her back
to Freeport as Mrs. Smith. They
-now have three boys. .„ ,., ..., ,..:-^^,.t.^.. f.
Some 2 7 years with the Brook-lyn
Trust and the Manufacturers
Trust Company were Len&#x27;s basic
training for the Village Treasurers
position. But first he spent sever-al
years on the Planning Board,
nine years on the Village Board and then in February 1955 moved in-to
the Treasurer&#x27;s Department. Last March he supervised the in-stallation
of a modern IBM systemwhich not only brings more modern
business methods to the Village&#x27;s fiscal programs at present but also
is geared to handling future growth, and both at considerable sav-ings
to the taxpayers.
Leonard is justly proud of a new type assessment and tax roll
which he devised and which was approved by the Tax Equalization
Bureau in Albany. He is also actively interested in the New York
State Municipal Electric Utility Association of which he was a former
President and now a Trustee.
A summer place in New Hampshire suffers from Len&#x27;s neglect
because he just can&#x27;t seem to leave village affairs to spend very much
time there.
*****
BOARD OPPOSES PLAN TO ABOLISH VILLAGE COURT
The recommendation of the New York State Judicial Conference
that the office of Village Police Justice be abolished is being met with
unanimous opposition of Freeport Officials.
A resolution demanding continuance of the Village Court has
been sent to members of the State Legislature and other State Of fie-icials.

When Gregory W. Murray
terms his experience on the Zoning
Board of Appeals as &quot;one of the most
rewarding and stimulating experiences
I have ever had&quot;, it is rare tribute,
for Greg has lived in a number of towns,
both as a civilian and as a Lieutenant
Commander in the Navy.
Boston born Greg acquired
his civic interest from his father
Michael J. Murray, for many years a
State Senator in Massachusetts. His
love for the Navy he acquired from his
&#x27;V&quot;brbthe&quot;r7 the&#x27;famous four star Admiral
George D. Murray, skipper of the re-nowned
Enterprise.
Greg attended GeorgetownUn-iversity
in Washington, D. C. He mar-ried
Alice Monahan of Watertown,
Mass, and they have a daughter Carol.
The retail home furnishings business
has been Greg&#x27;s specialty for many
years—he was formerly with W &amp; J
Sloanes and is currently with the Huffman and Boyle chain.
After some World War II wandering Greg, Alice and Carol
moved to Freeport in 1948. He is president of the United Fund and a
past president of the South West Civic Association. As Chair man of the

Clinton Walling boasts a unique
family tradition of service to Freeport
—his father was the first superintend-ent
of the Power House in the Village,
a post he held for 48 years. Clint has
been with the power plant some 41
years himself and has been Superin-tendent
of Electric Utilities since 1927
—when he succeeded his father in that
post.
Clint, an engineer out of Pratt
Institute, is mighty proud of the power
plant-nine of the largest municipal dies-el
power plantSni^ne^U^^S^&#x27;-H^&#x27;^oints-out
that its power output nas increased
51% in the last 4 years. More impor-tant
than that, however, is the fact that
the village residents pay 8% less for
their power than residents in surround-ing
communities. In addition, the vil-lage
saves $ 126, 000 a year onits street
light costs through utilization of the
Clinton H. Walling
Supt. Electric Utilities
power plant. Since its inception when it cost $16, 000 to erect, the pow-er
plant has furnished the village with over $2 millionin free power serv-ices.
Clint and his wife, the former Clara Thelma Braxator, a native
of Germany whom Clint met in Freeport, live at 84 Leonard Avenue,
and they have a son, William B. who is a doctor in Hicksville, and two
grandchildren. Boats and boating are the big hobbies in Clint&#x27;s life but
they play a poor second to the power plant.
The 48 civil service employees in the Power and Light Depart-ment
help Clint furnish service to 13, 000 customer s in the village. While
he looks forward to retirement in a few year s, Clint still has some plans
for improvements on the books which he would like to see consummated
before he steps down. * * * * * * *

Cord Viebrock, Chairman of
the Freeport Housing Authority, will
soon celebrate 50 years in America-
— and, as he came here at the age of
13 from Bremen, Germany, this is
one way of revealing his age. Cord
had no formal education in America
but he did have strong ambition, abil-ity
to work hard and an abundance of
common sense. He was soon a suc-cessful
merchant operating ice cream
and candy stores in various localities
around the metropolitan area and then
settled in Freeport in 1932.
Cord is a gold star father —
his son Lt. John Viebrock was killed
while with the AmericanArmy in Eu-rope.
In 1946 Cord became a mem-ber
of the Planning Board, in 1947-
48 the Zoning Board and in 1949 a Vil-lage
Trustee, a post to which he was re-elected regularly. In January
1958 he resigned to become chairman of the Housing Authority.
Under his supervision, a garden-type apartment has been built
inFreeport consisting of 1 to 6 room units at no cost to the Village due
to a combination of government subsidy and a plan for self liquidation
of costs over the next 40 years, the end of which time full title reverts
to the municipality. One of Cord&#x27;s proudest accomplishments is the
plans and details for the Elderly Citizens Housing soon to materialize
in our village.
Cord is married to the former Henrietta Waetje, who was also
born inGermany. They met, however, in America. They have a mar-ried
daughter, Harriet Zimm, and four grandchildren. A former mem-ber
of the Freeport Merchants Association and past president of the
Chamber of Commerce, Cord admits today that the Housing Authority
is his biggest hobby.

Raymond T. Keirnan
Purchasing Agent
The Keirnan a are an old Free-port
family and Raymond T. Keirnan,
Village Purchasing Agent was one of
10 Keirnan children. Ray&#x27;s connec-tion
with municipal affairs goes back
a bit, if indirectly, to when his father
Patrick Keirnan owned a home on
the site of the present municipalbldg .
Ray served as Park commis-sioner
from 1947 to 1953. A former
captain of the Freeport High School
Football team (1923) sport minded Ray
brought paid professionall football
games to the Freeport .Stadium. In.
1947 he was successful in getting the
New York Yankees to play the Chicago
Rockets at the Stadium. From the
time he joined the Park Commission
the Stadium has operated in the black .
Serving as chair man of the Park
Commission from 1952-1953, Ray be-came
Village Inspector also in 1952
and became Village Purchasing Agent in 1954. He places a quarter of
a million a year in purchases, exclusive of those he handles for the
power plant. He operates his procurement activity along quotation and
bid methods approved by New York State. Through standardization of
purchasing Ray proudly states he has saved considerable money for
the taxpayers. He also follows a policy of placing as much pur chasing
locally as possible. Ray&#x27;s background with the Nestle Company and
with Grumman Aircraft give him a sound background in progressive
management.
Married to former Evelyn W.Randall, of Hampstead.New Hamp-shire,
Ray has a multitude of interests including music, books and a
half dozen civic enterprises. With his pipe and bland manner you might
not suspect that Ray is a &quot;Can do&quot; guy who really gets things done and
done well.

*************
PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS KNOW YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS
There are some pretty solid a-chievements
in Nathan P. Zablow&#x27;s
background but somehow you get the
impression that this Planning Board
member gets a particular kick out of
having originated the Bicycle Safety
Commission (of which he is chairman)
to make Freeport one of the first vil-lages
on Long Island to license bikes.
Nobody can accurately estimate just
how many children&#x27;s lives have thus
been^,sayed,as a_ re suit, but even one
would be a blessing and&quot; it is &quot;certain-ly
more than one.
Manhattan born Zablow attended CC
NY, University of Idaho (where he car-ried
a pigskin) and NYU Law School
where he received a sheepskin. He had
been practicing law just one year when,
in 1934, he and the former Rhoda Gould
of the Bronxwere married. They have
two children, Suellen Faith, 11, arid
Bruce Charles, 9, both attending the
Nathan P. Zablow,
Comm. of Planning Board
The Zablow&#x27;s moved to Freeport just nine years ago and since then
have rolled up an impressive record of civic activity. Mrs. Zablow
has beenactive on the Bicycle Safety Commissionand Nathan is a member
of the Rotary; a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee for the New
High School and a member of the Auxiliary Police. He is alsoa member
of the Bar Association of Nassau County.
Nat was appointed to the Planning Board in 1954 and re-appointed for
a five year term in 1956. He practices law from his office at 126 West
Me rrick Road. In one of the most unusual cases he handled he proved,
in a Kings County court, that the Drunk-O-Meter, used on one of his
clients, -was not a specific test for alcohol as it could be influenced by
onions or by garlic.
When not knee-deep in village and civic affairs, Nathan&#x27;s hobbies are
golf and boating. The latter interest is hardly a secret as his boat sits
right in his backyard and his home in the Bay Estates section is almost
as close as you can get to water and still be on la. i
The Friends of the Freeport Memorial Libr=T-r are sponsoring a
reception on Wednesday evening, July 22nd, 1959, from 8:30-10:00 P. M.
in the Conference Room of the Library, in honor of Mrs. Elizabeth F.
Kelly, who is retiring as Library Director. The public is invited.
A heart warming success story in
the American tradition--that sums up
the background of Harry Chuisano who
started work for the Village as a la-borer
in 1930, and today heads up the
Highway and Sanitation Department.
Freeport-born Harry has lived all of
his life in the East End section of Free-port.
Many will recall his prowess in
basketball and baseball at Freeport
High during the years 1925 unf.il his
graduation in 1929j the year he had a
try out with&quot; the New York Giants.
Harry.is a past chief of the Free-port
Fire Department (1948-1949) and
a past, commander of the American
Legion(1952). He served three years
in the Navy but when his hitch was up,
high-tailed it back to Freeport and his
Village career.
Until 1952, the Highway Department
and Sanitary Department were sepa-rate
divisions. At that time the two
rjwe re=~me r-ge d^arid- both .-aow.i&lt;?all.mnde-ri&lt;
He is proud of the recently completed 400 car parking lot on Mill Road
which his department installed at no expense to the Village. They will
also do the parking area on Liberty Avenue for the Bennington Park.
Harry points with pride to the fact that Freeport is one of the few
villages on Long Island which give the service of rear door garbage
collection. Theyare soon to add another^ service: 2 rubbish collections
a week in addition to the two garbage collections.
Under Harry Chuisano&#x27;s direction are some 60 people and 22 vehi-cles.
It is their job not only to collect refuse and incinerate it, but
to handle snow removal as well, and to perform street and highway
maintenance. They also use fill from the incinerator to reclaim marsh
land.
&quot;We are very proud&quot;Harry says, &quot;of the job we do inkeepingFree-port
a clean village and a healthy village. Our job may not be glam-orous
but no one can deny it is vitally important. And we are con-stantly
thinking up new ways to be of greater service to the folks in
Freeport, for, after all, this is our town too. &quot;

If you were to write up a set of
ideal qualifications for the Park Com-mission,
James P. Stares&#x27; back-ground
would fit almost perfectly.
Jim&#x27;s &quot;family had operated a restau-rant
in Freeport for many years and
Jim himself has been a resident since
1923--and Jim operated Point Look-out
Town Park concessions and vari-ous
beach clubs at Atlantic Beach as
a lad just out of Syracuse University.
-That--might .be., considered -a fair
background in itself, but Jim&#x27;s main
job, Assistant Superintendent of Me-thods
for the WesternElectric Com-pany&#x27;s
Telephone Division, has him
££p.Qnsibleit,,atmo.n.g^oJ:]j^.^
the company&quot; s concessions and cafe-terias
all over the nation. Small won-der
Freeport receives more money
from its Stadium concessions than
ever before.
Jim was graduated from Freeport
High in 1928, where he made a mark
in public speaking, dramatics and the track team. He took his degree
in Business Administration at Syracuse in 1^32. In&quot; 1942 he joined
WesternElectric and hasbeenwith themsince. And exactly ten year s
later he joined the Park Commission.
As a Park Commissioner, Jim works in close conjunction with the
Village Engineers &quot;in planning &quot;improvements, expansions&#x27;and modifi-cations.
Jim&#x27;s hobbies are boating, fishing and bridge. He is married to
his childhood sweetheart, Catherine Kimbis, formerly of Jackson
Heights and they have two sons, Peter, who works in the City and
lives at home, and Dennis, who is in his sophomore year at Penn
State. *******
Attention has been called to the fact that many persons unthinkingly
are putting grass andhedge clippings andleaves loose in the gutters.
This in itself is wrong for the Ordinance requir- ? that all material

James P. Staros,
Park Commissioner
All-Freeport is atermyou might
apply to Bill Crevoiserat for, he
was not only born in Freeport, he
has lived her call of his life, and all
of his business and public affairs
have centered in Freeport. Charter
memberships are almost common
to Bill for he is a charter member
of the Chamber of Commerce; the
North East Civic Association (of^
which he is a Senior Past President
and has been Treasurerfor 30 years)
and the Freeport Republican Club.
Freeport Citizen of the Year in
1955, Bill was a member of Free-port&#x27;s
first Zoning Board back in
MiYAUag^
Chairman of the Water Commission
and Street Commission; one of the
sponsors of the Freeport Stadium
and a member of the Fire Depart-ment
for thirty years.
Bill is proud of the deep well sys-tem
with elevated storage tank which
he was^responsible for and which was installed in 1928. It was his
intimate -knowledge of the streets, trunk lines, old&quot; lakes, under-ground
streams which helped so much in the planning of the Village
Water System. Bill became Superintendent of the Water Department
in 1954 and he now has under way a 10 year progress plan covering
improvements, changes and future projects for our. water system. .
This system is fairly formidable consisting, as it does, of 2 eleva-ted
tanks, 7 wells, 125 miles of mains, 950 hydrants, 8600 custo-mers
and supplies 32,000 people, as well as industry and business
with over a billion gallons of water per year.
Thoroughbred poultry, for which he has won an amazing 500 rib-bons,
is one of Bill&#x27;s chief hobbies, with the raising of prize-winning
dahlias a close second. Bill is a widower with two daughters, 5
grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren.

The name Malone has been a fa-miliar
one in Freeport since 1901,
when the Malone family began spend-ing
summers here. But Raymond,
member of the Zoning Board of Ap-peals,
was born in Brooklyn. Ray
was educated in Freeport schools and
has maintained a keen interest in
Freeport education ever since.
He entered the Army as a private
in 1941 and emerged as a Captain in
1946. At a USO dance he met Amelia
Huvelie of-ManhattaLn and theyv.were*.&#x27;&#x27;
married in 1942. At the end of the
war they returned to Freeport, where
they have since been busy raising four
children, Renee 14, Eileen 11, Ray-mond
Junior 8 and Stephen 7.

pany. As Eastern Ad Manager, Ray supervises a baker&#x27;s dozen of
salesmen, arranges advertising seminars and manages to bring in
•well over a million dollars a year in ad billing for his company.
Vigorous, aggressive and public spirited Ray Malone has served
on numerous official boards and committees. From 1951 to 1952 he
served on the Transportation Committee, from 1952 to 1953 on the
Safety Council and from. 1954 to 1958 was a member of the Planning
Board. He has also served for I&#x27;l&quot; years as a&#x27;member&#x27;of the Citizens
Advisory Committee on Education and was co-chairman of that group
from 1953 to 1958. He was appointed to the Zoning Board of Appeals
in 1958. He is also a member of the Southwest Civic Association.
Ray&#x27;s favorite interest, expressed loud and clear and often, is the
continued improvement and betterment of Freeport. But he manages
to find time for a sail and a bit of fishing with the younger Malones in
their boat.
&quot;Freeport&quot;, says Ray, &quot;is not only a great town now but it is show-ing
far more initiative and imagination than the majority of suburban
communitie s in anticipating and planning for future gr owth and impr ove -

A trans planted native of theGar-den
State of New Jersey is Robert
N. Kinsey, Superintendent of Park-ing
Meters and Superintendent of
Water Meters. Bob forsook Jersey
City, his birthplace, some years
ago whenhe became a Freeport res-ident
and booster.
Bob and the four technicians he
supervises are responsible for all
of the installation, repair and main-tenance
of the Village&#x27;s 8, 600 water
•meters---arid••lv&#x27;52&#x27;5&quot; parking meters;•----
Keeping the~se~ &quot;tricky ]gadge&quot;ts~ in ef- ~
ficientworking order is a man-size
job often calling for ingenuity and
improvisation. But Bob and his crew
enjoy the challenge and recognize
that their work contributes to the
Village income.
Bob&#x27;s department, though small
in numbers, is among the most im-portant
from a health and safety
standpoint. Bob Kinsey feels thajt any success he has had as a Super-intendent
can be summed in the following statement: &quot;We are part of
a team and I appreciate the cooperation I get from the other depart-ments&#x27;arid
department heads. Without this team &quot;effort we could not
be where we are. &quot;
During WorldWar II Bob worked for Republic Aviation as a flight
line maintenance man and has put this experience to sounduse in^his
present assignment. Bob began asra water meter mechanic in 1951
with the Village and in 1956he was made superintendent of the water
and parking meters.
Bob was Chief of the Fire Department in 1950 and 1951 and still
maintains a deepinterest in fire prevention as a member of the Fire
Council.
The Kinseys are an all-Freeport family. Bob and the former
Majel Raynor ofJTreeport were married in 1934 and fheir 3 children
and their 3 grandchildren all live in Freeport. Robert Junior works
for the Village Line Department and sonHarold works for the County.

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
AlanKellock, member of the Free -
port Planning Board, is one of those
rare individuals who divided his ed-ucation
and subsequent career into
equal parts of commercial business
success and public service. He took
his A. B. in Business Administra-tion
at Antioch College, yet one of
his outstanding accomplishments was
a research report on County .govern-ment.
Upon graduation he got a job
in the Department of Labor and left
: it for *a position&quot; with the&quot; New &#x27; York
Stock Exchange; From this he went
into another field writing publicity;
promotion and motion picture produc -
tion for some eight years with Union
Carbide Company.
Then came three hard year s in the
Queen of Battle s - -the infantry - -where
Alan went through the Palau Islands
and the Philippine Islands campaigns.
Then to McGraw Hill where he has re-mained
since as Production Manager
of the Test Films Department, which
distributes education films to business, industry and--here is that
split again--to local and federal governments.
The Kellocks adopted Freeport in 1946 and Mrs. Kellock thougha
native of Cleveland, Ohio and a former coed at Antioch, feels right
at home here. So does Alan Junior, who is 16 and a senior at Free-port
High; Susan aged 12 and Thomas aged 9.
Alan joined the Southwest Civic Association almost the day he moved
to Freeport and soon became that group&#x27;s delegate to the Allied Civic
Council and a member of the Committee which obtained adoption by the
Village Government of the County Assessment System. He was elected
President of the S. W. Civic Association in 1951 and served as such
until he moved to north Freeport. He was appointed to the Power
Plant Commission in 1951 and serveduntil 1958whenhe was appointed
to the Planning Board. His keen interest in education has been reflec-ted
in his serving as co-chairman and chairman of the Citizens Advi-sory
Committee on Freeport Education since 195°
Alan&#x27;s hobbies--books, films, and photography--take a very poor
second to Freeport and its problems and potentials.

Member, Planning Board

Everyone remembers the poem
which begins &quot;For the lack of a nail,
a shoe was lost...&quot; and goes on all
the way through to show how an en-tire
battle was lost simply because
no one, had a horseshoe nail. John
Marra, Freeport Storekeeper, who
supplies Village departments with
over 5, 000 items rangingfrom wash-ers
to light poles, isn&#x27;t going to let
Freeport lose anything through lack
of supplies. John supervises a com-
- bination -hardware*- store; plumbing&lt;••*«--
supply .house and electrical ware.-.,
house and John is the entire staff of
the department. His stock, which
he requisitions and which the Vill-age
Purchasing Agent procures, is
worth $175, 000.
No stranger to Freeport John was
born in New York City but has lived
in the Village since 1921. He served
17 years with the Board of Education
as Head Custodian of the Columbus
Avenue School. He also did a two
year stint with the Navy during World War II.
Most Freeporters know John not through his storekeeper work nor
through the warehouse he runs for the Village next to the powerhouse
but for his 31 years with Engine Company 1 and for his term as Fire
Chief in 1952 and 1953. Kids in the Village know him as the wizard
who is chairman of the annual Fourth of July fireworks show at the
rFreeport stadiumy an-assignment he has&#x27; held-for the -past five-years.
John is proud to report that about 13,000 attend this spectacular
event each year and he quickly notes that&#x27;it would be more if the sta-dium
were larger.
A pretty active fellow in civic affairs, John is a member of the
North East Civic Association and the American Legion Post. He has
also been a member of the Nassau County Fire Commission (1955),
Chairman of the 2nd Battalion Fire District, the same year, and Past
President (1956) of the Freeport Exempt Fireman&#x27;s Association.
In 1931 John met Margaret Giordano of Freeport and soon she be-came
Mrs. Marra. They have two daughters, Mrs. John MarsTiallof
Laurelton and Carol Marra, who is a secretary at Grummans. And
they have two granddaughters as well. John is a rarity in Freeport--
a fresh water fisher man--and he spends a good deal of his vacation
time at a hunting and fishing lodge he owns at Hancock, N. Y.

The repaving of SouthGrove Street from Sunrise Highway to Front
Street makes a mile and twotenths more of road improvement in the
Village of Freeport.
PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
When it comes to knowing Long
Island, Manhattan born Gustav J.
Berkel, Member of the Sewer Com-mission,
bows to no man. For when
Gus came to the Island in 1917 sell-ing
an ice cream line he covered his
territory, town by town, on a bike.
Pedalling through Freeport he took a
special liking for the place and by
1923, the L. I. R. R. had replaced the
bicycle as Gus1 mode of transporta-tion
and he and_ the former Jeannie
E. Rein moved into 216 Pine Street
and they are there yet.
Gus spent his whole business life
in the ice cream business and when
he retired in 1957 he had gone along
way from be ing a salesman on a bike*
Gus was the Sales Promotion and
Merchandising Representative of the
Pioneer Ice Cream division of the
Borden Company. His retirement
gave him, as he puts it, &quot;the time
to give freely to the various aspects
of civic administration, in particular the challenging problems of the
Sewer Commission.&quot;
Time is something Gus has always given. He served on the Draft
Board for District #4 in World War II; he was a member of the Park
Commission from 1936 to 1938 and Chairman from 1938 to 1941. He
was a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals from 1941 to 1943 and
has served as a member of the Sewer Commission since 1954. Always
ready to take on extra duties, Gus has served on many special com-missions
appointed by the Mayor. He has also found time to be a mem-ber
of the Grand Jurors Association of Nassau County; Life member
of the Elks and member of the Southwest Civic Association.
Gus is proud of the progress the Sewer Commissionhas made with
90% of the Village now connected and by I960 the entire Village will
be 100% connected to the modern sewer system. Gus is also proud of
the four children he and Jeannie have raised in the 49 years of their
marriage, not to mention their 19 grandchildren. Gus and Jeannie
still keepthat 8-room house on Pine Street which may seem like a lot
of house for two people but it often seems much too small when the
children and grandchildren all come to visit.
Gustav J. Berkel,
Member, Sewer Commission
KNOW YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS
Some people might think of Free-portas
a reasonably small communi-ty
but to Edwin C. McKeeman, Super-intendent
of Sewerage operations, it
seems awfully big whenyou consider
that he is responsible for over 100
miles of sewer lines--the equivalent
of a pipeline running from the Village
clear to Philadelphia. Ed and his 15
employees supervise this vast oper-ation
in which 3-1/2 million gallons
daily flow into the treatment station
south of the Freeport&#x27;Stadium.
So basic is modern, sanitary sew-age
operation to the health and well
being of the Village that Ed has stu-died
this subject, and advancements
in techniques at Union College, Cor-nell
University, New York Universi-ty,
as well as at the State Lab in Al-bany.
He has also kept in constant
touch with sewage administrators in
surr ounding state s and communitie s.
Freeport born and educated--as
is his wife the former Lillian Streeseman--Ed started his Village
career working on the die sel engines in the power house back in 1925.
He advanced to the point where, in 1943, he was manager of the Sani-tation
Department. In 1952 when the Sewage Division was made a
separate department Ed became the head of this new organization.
Ed has been a mernbe.r .of Hose Company #4 since 1922. He was
Chief of the Freeport Fire Department iii 1935.- A. charter member
of the New York Sewage 8t Industrial Waste Association, he also served
as President of the State Sewer Association, an organization of over
600 members. He is a member of the N. J. Sewage Waste Association
anda member of the Federation ofSewage and Industrial Waste Asso-ciation,
an international organization.
Noting that Freeport had a main pumping station and 3 sub-stations
for auxiliary duty, Ed points out that an $800, 000 improvement pro-gram
is to be started shortly to increase the capacity of the plant to
care for an eventual population of 37, 000. Ed feels this will keep the
Village comfortably ahead of sewage requirements to meet anticipated
increases in population.
The McKeemans have one child--Jean, who attends Junior High--
and they live at 123 New York Avenue.

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
A famous first is Patricia D.
Collins of 325 Pine Street--the first
lady Commissioner in the history of
Freeport. As Vice Chairman of the
Zoning Board of Appeals, Pat uti-lizes
her extensive legal background
to great advantage.
A lifelong resident of Freeport,
..Pat grew^up on Miller A ve,nue, where
her father, the late James Collins,
a member of the Freeport Actor&#x27;s
Colony, lived among the other great
Thespians. She attended Holy Re-deemer;
St. Agnes Academy High
SchoolandSt. John&#x27;s University Col-lege
&amp; Law School. She was gradu-ated
from the latter in 1951 with
her LLB and the distinction of being
on the Dean&#x27;s List.
Then things began to happen. Pat
opened her own law office within a Patricia D. Collins,
year, one she still maintains at 22 V.&#x27;Chrmn. , Zon. Bde of Appeals
PineStreet0 She was then admitted
to practice in all Courts of New York
State and, in May of this year, she will be admitted to practice be-fore
the highest Court in the land, The Supreme Court of the United
States.
A busy private practice and a heavy civic schedule has not kept
Pat from other activities. She served as Vice President of the South-west
Civic Association in.195.8 .and that same year she was Chairman
of the Freeport Cancer Drive which went &#x27;way over the top. She has
also-served, since 1943,-as a-Director-and Counsel for Our Lady of
Consolation Residence for the Aged, in A mity ville. Patisalsoa mem-ber
of the Nassau County Women&#x27;s Bar Association; The Nassau County
Bar Association; and, since January 1st, 1958, she has been Assis-tant
Town Attorney for the Town of Hempstead.
Like most busy people, Pat manages to sandwich in charitable
work; civic work and yet never neglect her private practice. She takes
a great delight in her Zoning Board work too. &quot;It&#x27;s a greathonor to
be the first woman to serve as a Village Commissioner!1, Pat says.
&quot;I want to do an extra special job so that more women may, in the
future, be encouraged to take their proper place in Village adminis-tration&quot;.

Most population movements are
from east to west, but Charles H.
Whitty, of 27 Martha St., who super-vises
all electrical maintenance in
the Village as Line Construction Su-pervisor
reversed the trend. Hewas
born in New Jersey; spent a number
of years in deep Alaska working for
the^ AlaskaniRailrjoad^l300. ;mileX up
the Yukon and then came back to set-tle
down in Long Island, where he
joined the Long Island Lighting Com-pany,
for whom he had worked brief-ly
prior to his northern jaunt.
Charles met a Virginia gal in New
Jersey, married her in 1937 and
brought her to Long Island. The wan-derlust
satisfied, Charles came to
Freeport in 1940, where he joined the
Electric Dept. and started raising
their two boys and a girl; Bryan, a
Freeport High graduate; John, a Free -
port High Junior, and Ruth, a Free-port
High Senior. Bryan, by the way,
works for the Village in the Line Department.
Charles has some 20 men and a fleet of trucks under his super-vision.
This crew maintains all electrical lines, new lines, under-ground
and overhead and the planning and laying out of new lines as
needed. They also must trim troublesome trees and the headaches
that heavy storms bring. Sleet and wind are the two devils most feared
by line men and when the sleet is slickand heavy on the lines Charles
^and his-crew-are- on the-job-24 hours a day untilthe danger is pastor—
the lines repaired.
In addition to his years with the Long Island Lighting Company,
Charles is a member of the Municipal Electrical Utilities Association
and has attended schools and seminars conducted by themto improve
his professional know-how. He is a member of the Harbor CivicAsso-ciation.
TheWhittys spend their summer vacations in Virginia--where it&#x27;s
warm—but a little bit of Charles&#x27; heart still pines for Alaska. How-ever,
he&#x27;s quick to admit, while he would like to visit the frozen tun-dra
once more, his roots are firmly plantedin the rich, black soil of
Freeport.

Line Construction Supervisor

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
Freeport born and raised and
Freeport educated that is the proud
boast of Julius L. Mintz, Counselor
At Law and member, since Novem-ber
1958, of the Freeport Zoning
Board of Appeals, Julie went to the
Columbus Avenue School; Freeport
Junior-Highj-FTe&#x27;eport-High-aTrd-thenj
only because the Village does not
have a law school, he took his law
degree at the Brooklyn Law School
in 1950. . .
Julie was true to Long Island when
he met the former Francine Green-span
of Rockville Centre on--of all
places--the Long Island Railroad.
The year was 1950 and soon the two
commuter s were married. Theynow
have two children, Joan 7 and Bobby
4. Joan attends Caroline G. Atkin-son
School.
Julie is the son of the late Isidore
Mintz of Freeport. Julie&#x27;s mother
still resides at the Grand Avenue
home the Mintz built in Freeport some 36 years ago. Brother Sidand
sister Tillie were also graduated from Freeport High. This, Julie
says, is by way of partial explanation of his deep and continuing inter-
.7est,dnJ:he~gx.ow,tlx.and^fur£her^^
&quot;This is a great village,&quot; Julie says. &quot;With the third generation of
my family growing up in it I guess that, in a way, is evidence of what
I. think of Freeport and why I am so interested in its people and its
problems. &quot;
A former member of the Air Corp Engineers, Julie served three
years overseas in the CBI--the China --Bur ma --India theatre. It was
plenty rough, Julie admits, but he now feels it was an invaluable edu-cation
in seeing and getting to understand a part of the world which is
becoming increasingly important in world affairs.
When it comes to hobbies, Julie, whose private law practice keeps
him on the go, divides his leisure between golf and bowling but they
take a poor second place to the youngsters.

John T. Capozzoli, General Su-pervisor
of Sanitation, though New
York born, has been a Freeport res-ident
for 40 years anda Village em-ployee
for 31. John is very proud
of the Village sanitation program.
He boasts that we are the only vill-gev~
onr=-Lon-g&#x27;Island with&quot; rear door&quot;
garbage pick-up, a boon to busy
housewives.
John&#x27;s crew--some 30 men on
the road; 13 men in the plant and 10
trucks collect and burn some 60 to
70 tons of waste each day. They
work in two eight-hour shifts. The
residue from the incinerated waste
is used as fill in the swamps south
of the plant.
Few people connect excitement
with sanitation work but John has
had some interesting moments, such
as the time a Freeport lady lost two
diamond rings in her garbage can.
By the time she discovered the loss
all of the garbage had been collected. John found the truck that had
collected fromher streetjhad all the garbage dumped in an open area
and found both rings!

name was the same as her married name. They have six children,
five boys and one girl, all of whom attended Freeport schools and two
of whom, Anthony and Robert, are in Freeport High. They are pr.oud
also of their two grandchildren--their daughter, Carol, being married
to Robert Kinsey, Jr. of the Freeport Line Department.
Son Angelo works on the drain crew; son John Junior works for the
Line Department and son Joseph works for the Sanitation Department
as an incinerator operator.
Despite the long hours he spends on his Village duties, John has
found time to be active in civic and fraternal groups--he is a member
of the Elks, the American Legion and Treasurer of the Southwest
Civic Association. John is also an honorably discharged veteran of
World War II, having served as a sergeant in a tank destroyer outfit.

much chance that any situation will

Alice attended schools in Manhattan and came toFreeport in 1930.
She and her husband, a Dallas, Texas businessman^ liked it and stayed*-.
Today A lice takes great pleasure in her twodaughters, LillianConway
and Alice Anderson, Jr., who follows mom&#x27;s secretarial footsteps
by working as a secretary to an oil company in, of all places, Saudi
Arabia, some distance from Freeport.
&quot;I find municipal administration work most exciting, &quot;Alice says.
&quot;Mainly because it deals with people and their well being. Unlike a
big city, there is nothing impersonal in work in a Village suchas_our s_.
The problems the administration faces are problems of their friends
and neighbors and this always calls for understanding and compas-sionate
decisions on matters affecting the Village.&quot;
Alice can still run off a lively Chopin mazurka on the piano which,
with reading, are her two minor hobbies. Her major hobbies? Why
those three grandchildren, of course, who are. right close by in Free -
port so that grandma, when she isn&#x27;t checking the files, making ap-pointments,
keeping minutes or typing furiously, can spoil them to
her heart&#x27;s content--a privilege given to grandmothers.</dc:description>

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
If Freeport had a flag, you can
be sure it would now be flying over
the Western Electric plant in far off
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Charles
V. Brady would be responsible; for
Freeport has lost, througha job trans-fer
and promotion, this veteran West-ern
Electric executive, who came to
Freeport in 1949 and left his mark on
civic affairs and municipal accom-plishments,
• Charley resigned April 1st from
his various Village posts. He had a
lot of letters of resignation to write
too for.he served on the Board of Ed-
—ucationj^the-P&#x27;lannin^-Boa-rd^-the-Boa&#x27;rd-of
Governors of the Northwest Civic
Association; and was a member of the
South Shore Yacht Club. He served on
the Planning Board since 1954 and for
the last six months was Chairman. Charles V. Brady
Many will recall the contest for the Ex-Chairman, Planning Board
Board of Education seat which Char ley -v
won in 1957 with a large plurality. He was a Past President of the
Northwest Civic Association. ;&#x27;.
Most folks boast photo collections of the kids but Charley, who
has a hobby of photography, compiled a 10 year record of Freeport
growth on colored slides which he has now donated to the Freeport
Public Library and which will prove, as the years gpby, to be aninyalu--
able historical record of the Village. In his free time, which with his
many civic duties was very little, Charley enjoyed boating, a pastime
he will find difficult to maintain in inland Oklahoma City.
As they trekwestward, Charley and his wife--the former Elizabeth
Akey whom he met at Western Electric 27 years ago--leaye behind
a host of friends and well wishers. Important though that is, of
even greater importance is the fact that in the eleven year in which
they made Freeport their home, the Bradys contributed so much to the

Mayor Glacken summed it up when he said recently: &quot;No matter
wherehis career takes him Charley Brady will make the town in which
he resides a better placebo live for he typifies the selfless civic-minded
citizen who-in hamlets, villages and cities across this country each
contributes to making our nation great.&quot;
KNOW YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS
Marguerite Johnson—whom ev-eryone
calls Marge --a Village em-ployee
since 1923, has the unique
distinction of having .served, under-*
eleven different Mayors. Marge now
serves as Deputy Village Clerk and
Registrar of Vital Statistics. Her
Village career began as assistant
clerk when the Village office was
located in a store on Merrick Road
near Church Street.
Freeport bornand raised, Marge
feels that the Village has changed
only in its physical size and appear-ance
.She^e^s that Freeport
Marguerite Johnson,
Deputy Village Clerk
a^re^still&#x27;the same, although she is
amazed when she checks her statis-tics
to see how many more of them
there, are now than there were when
she started her career thirty-seven
years ago.
Marge is responsible for all Vil-lage
licenses --whether it&#x27;s a license
to operate a taxi, to open a restau-rant,
have a dog or put in new plumbing. Marge has a fund of amus-ing
anecdotes concerning situations she has encountered in fulfilling
this res ponsibility^ She alsohas to answer a number of unusual ques-tions
such as the time a little lad brought in his male dog and wanted
Marge to tell him why &quot;she&quot; couldn&#x27;t have any puppies.
The Business Wbmen of Freeport is one of Mar ge &#x27; s_ main_s pare -
time interests. She formerly served as Treasurer and Secretary of
this organization. Bowling is one ofMarge&#x27;sbig hobbies, but it vies
with oil painting and making silver jewelry— two other fields in which
Marge is extremely adept.
Marge was married to the late August Johnson, former paymaster
for the Long Island Railroad and member of the County Auditor&#x27;s
Office, who died in 1953. Many residents remember her brother,
&#x27;Dubs&#x27;ie&#x27;-Ha-nsen, &#x27;a &quot;fa mour^Free por f atnleieT&#x27;wno&#x27; now&#x27; &#x27;five Tin&#x27; Pough -
keepski. Her other brother, Peter, is: a resident of Detroit.
Did Marge have a favorite Mayor out of the eleven?

Tune in on
&quot;The new spirit in Freeport
The Village of Freeport is on the air --Station WGBB, 1240 on the
dial -- in a special radio feature to call attention to the many advan-tages
offered by Freeport as a desirable location for new business, a
centre of waterfront activities, and a much improved retail shopping
area.
A series of radio announcements is emphasizing the spirit of pro-gress
in Freeport which is bringing new business establishments into
the village, inspiring more attractive retail shopping facilities and
generating wide-spread interest in our community.
Recognizing that a sound business community is essential, to pro-vide
adequate revenue for badly needed village services and to ease
the tax burden on Residential property owners , the Village Board is
taking active steps to promote the benefits of Freeport.
&quot;Spot&quot; announcements of 60-second and 30-second duration have
been scheduled at the rate of about 20 per week, from November 29
through December 26. These village advertisements have been placed
near the WGBB news broadcasts (generally at five minutes before the
hour, news headlines on the half-hour, fifteen minute news review sat
7:15 a. m. and 12:00 noon).
In addition to announcements by the station.&#x27;s staff, the program-ming
includes taped messages by Mayor Sweeney, other village offi-cials
and leaders of Freeport business organizations.
HOURS FOR DUMPING PLANNING FOR FREEPORT&#x27;S FUTURE
The dump is open six days a week, Monday through Saturday ,
from 8:00 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. Residents may deliver refuse to the
incinerator area at any time during those hours.
Until recently a sign at the dump indicated that it was closed on
Saturdays after 12:30. However, Mr. Harry Chuisano, Superinten-dent
of Highways and Sanitation advises that the sign was in error
and the dump has not been closed at 12:30 on Saturdays for many
years. Due to an oversight the sign had been permitted to remain
unchanged until the discrepancy was called to the attention of the
Sanitation Department.
There is no charge to residents for disposing of household dis-cards
or refuse at the dump.
***
WATER TOWER REPAINTED
The 1, 000, 000 gallon water tower on the western approach to the
village is undergoing necessary maintenance and re-painting,. Mr.
William E. Crevoiserat, Superintendent of the Water Department,
points out that this is required every five or six year s and during the
work some residents may be inconvienced by occassionally draw-ing
discolored water. However, he advises that the work is scheduled
at a time to afford the least possible difficulty. Intelligent preventive
maintenance of the water systemhelps to assure an adequate water
supply and satisfactory pressure levels.
***
SNOW REMOVAL
To make it possible for rapid snow removal on village streets ,
car-s must not be allowed to remain pafkedat the curb when .there is..-.. ,
a snow fall.
Under ordinance 4. 5 of the Unified Code of Ordinances, cars must
be taken off the streets to permit snow plows to get through. The vil-lage
has made early preparations for effective snow removal but these
efforts will not be successful unless there is general cooperation on
this requirement of the law.
***
A master plan for the village is being evolved by a firm of planning
consultants recently employed, Raymond and May Associates, under
the supervision of the Planning Board and the Village Board of Trus-tees.
This master plan will require two years of study and will en-compass
a very broad scope of services. Some of the proposed stud-ies
are:
1. Aerial photographs, base maps, topographic map and land-use map.
2. Population study, including estimate of present population, maxi-mum
potential population, population to be achieved in accordance
with the type of development ^desired by the village.
3. Economic study: trends of public finance (income, expenditures,
tax rates, bonded indebtedness, etc.)
4. Housing study and neighborhood analysis: special study of neigh-borhoods,
delineation of residential areas, determination of bligh-ted
areas, analysis of each neighborhood in terms of its condition
and its needs.
5. Circulation plan: street and highway pattern, and major street
plan.
6. Public buildings and facilities, public utilities, parkand recrea-tion
areas.
7. Comprehensive plan for the future over-all land use, transporta-tion
and community facilities.
8. Capital improvement program: recommended priorities for future
public improvements. Plans for capital budgeting program over a
five-year period.
9. Zoning: review existing zoning laws and prepare necessary re-
-visions-to-earry out the cpmprehensive plan. .... -

PUBLISHED MONTHLY BY THE VILLAGE OF FREEPORT
May, I960
Work commenced on Little League Ball Field at East end of Sun-rise
Highway in Freeport. This additional field is needed to take care
of the increasing number of &quot;Little Leaguers&quot; that we now have in the
Village of Freeport.
PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
Harold C. Blinn,
Sewer Commissioner
You don&#x27;t have to tune inWyatt
Earp to see a real live sheriff for
Harold C. Blinn, Sewer Commission-er
of the Villagers a bonded Deputy
Sheriff for Nassau County. But, as
there are few rustlers to ride after
inNassau, Harold spends a good deal
of his time working for improved and
more efficient Village administration,
a cause which has received much of
his attention for a number of years.
Long Island has claimed most
of Harold&#x27;s effort in one way or an-other
as he spent some years with the
Long Is land Railroad, advancing from
clerk to Travelling Station Auditor and
later he was associated with the Coun-try
Life Press in Garden City. Active
in politics for many years, Harold is
Republican Committeeman of the 41st
Election District, a post he has held
for 12 years.
When it came to getting married
Commissioner Blinn was faithful to Long Island also and he met and
married Lois Davenport, a Roosevelt girl. Their daughter, Dorothy
(Mrs. Raymond Hecker), lives inSeaford, son Harry lives at home so
Harold doesn&#x27;t have to travel far to have a family reunion. A doting
g-randpa, he thinks his two grandsons are the greatest!
Harold has another distinction--he was in the Air Corps when
it was really in its infancy--he enlisted with the Air Corps early in
World War I, when Spads and Nieuports were considered hot planes,
and he served in England and France. An early member of the William
Clinton Story Post of the American Legion, he served two years as
Post Adjutant and one year as Vice Commander.
As to the Se\ver Commission onwhich he has served for sixyears
Harold says it runs smoothly and, while not a glamorous subject, it
&#x27; pTays&#x27;si &quot;vitaTVole in &#x27;keeping the&quot;Village~cTe~a~ri~VnxThealthy;&quot; &#x27; -...«.*•» --.
&quot;There is a spirit of genuine desire to serve the people of Free-port
on the part of all of the various commissions and services which
I have come in contact with in my years in the Village and I am proud
to be a small part of it&quot;, Harold says. &quot;Now let me tell you a little
more about my grandsons. . . &quot;
KNOW YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS
A good indication of the growth
of the Village may be had in talking
with Mrs. Lillian Steffens of 122
Church Street, who has been em-ployed
by the Village since 1924 and,,
since 1927, has held the position of
Deputy Treasurer. Thirty-six years
ago the Village sent out about 4, 000
tax bills, all handwritten. Today the
count is 11, 500 and all are handled
and recorded by modernl. B.M. ma-chines.
Brooklyn born, Lillian left that
borough for Freeport in 1920. She
has lived in her present house for 40
years. She has worked for three Vil-lage
Treasurers, Stephen Hunt, Gordon
Simonson and Leonard D. B. Smith.
An interesting coincidence is that she
was originally hired over three de-cades
ago by S. Dimon Smith, father
of the present Village Treasurer and
Assessor.
Lillian has the distinction of being the first woman who ever
attended the Municipal Training School in Albany, which she did during
the regime of Mayor Robert E. Patterson. She has also actively kept
up with the advancements in the increasingly complex problems of mu-nicipal
fiscal administration.
Among the many changes Lillian has noted is the fact that today
it is easier for the Village to collect its taxes partly due to the over-all
prosperity but mainly due to the fact that banks usually collect tax
payments along with mortgage payments. She also feels that people
are generally more careful about keeping their tax payments prompt
than they were years ago.

NOW HEAR THIS - All Boat and Property Owners of Waterfront!
Your attention is respectfully called to the new rules and regu
lations governing the operation and mooring of boats in our residen-tial
canals.
Generally speaking, in the canals which are in the residential
districts, no person shall moor or dock a boat other than PARALLE
to the bank and in a single line and at all times, a person operating
a boat shall do so in a careful and prudent manner and at such rate
of speed so as not to disturb the reasonable comfort or endanger the
property or the life and limb of others or to interfere with the free
use by others of the channel and in particular, without throwing up
dangerous wake when approaching another boat.
No boat shall be operated at a speed greater than 12 miles per
hour in channels or at a speed greater than 4 miles per hour in any
basin, dock anchorage or boating area.
In the residential districts, the renting of dock space is per-mitted
provided that the total number of boats does not exceed one
boat for each 30 linear feet on the waterfront. It must be pointed
out that the offering to rent of dock space on unimproved property
is forbidden. While a commercial boat may be docked in a residen-tial
zone, the dock cannot be used for the loading or unloading of
cargo, or embarking or disembarking of passengers.</dc:description>

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
&quot;It&#x27;s a nice place to visitand I
would like to live there.&quot;
That, we can assume, was Loren
E. (Pete) Hebl&#x27;s reaction when he vis -
ited Freeport in 1934, for ten years
later, when he was transferred to the
, SJienp,il C_qmpany&#x27; s New^ Yor^ojfice, _ fc|
Pete moved right out to Freeport,
where he has been ever since.
Wisconsin born Pete Hebl was
graduated from the University of
Wisconsin with a PhB with State.
Teaching Permit and a major in
Physics and a minor in Math. He
joined the Shell Oil Company in 1928
shortly after graduation. In 1935
.young Pete became Chief Research
Engineer at the Shell Engine Research
Laboratory. He also became a hus-band
that year when he met and mar-ried
Thelma Schwartz, also of the
Shell Company.
An Air Force veteran, Pete, who
was assigned to Air Research and
Development after his return from
service, and for the fifteen years since, has been Products Applica-tion
Engineer involved with various technical and scientific engineer-ing
committees of the automotive industry; the oil industry and the
Armed Forces.
When Pete and&#x27; Thelma moved here in &#x27;44, son Jerry was a six
year old and Jill a one year old. Jerry was recently inducted into
the Army and daughter Jill will graduate from Freeport High in June
and has been accepted at Cazenovia College in New York State.
__ Pete&#x27;s 1954 appointment to the then newly formed Utilities Com-mittee
in Freeport was an odd&quot; coincidence, in a way, as Pete on his
visit to the Village in 1934 had expressed considerable interest in the
Village&#x27;s approach to municipal power and its utilization. In 1955
Pete was appointed to the Municipal Board of Water and Light Com-missioners.
He has concentrated mostly on matters involving coordi-nating
Freeport1 s rate of growth with future equipment needs and with
searching studies of municipal power rates.
The Hebls live at 446 Archer Street and they are pretty sold on
Freeport. &quot;Living here is a 12 months&#x27;vacation&quot;, say Pete and Thelma
who share interests in photography, bowling and music.

Member, Municipal Board of
Water &amp; Light Commissioners
FUNCTION OF
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized by Village Law and con-sists
of five members appointed for three-year terms by the Village
Board of Trustees.
After due notice to affected property owners and at a public hear-
.,ing=-the ,Zoning».B;Oar,d_may .grant,per.mits, .commonly. know-n-aB^varj..-^
ances, modifying or varying the strict application of the Zoning Or-dinance.
There are approximately twenty specific instances where variances
may be granted.
These range from parking modifications; modifying the aggregate
use of horsepower in electrical industrial motors to land use vari-ances
such as the construction of buildings without the required plot
area, and the required front, rear, and side yard setbacks.
These exceptions may be granted on proof of practical difficulty
and unnecessary hardship when they will not substantially depreciate
the value of other properties or .appreciably alter .the character of
the neighborhood.
The Board is also called upon to hear another type of case, gen-erally
called a &quot;fact finder&quot;.
These cases entail the ascertaining of facts to prove that certain
conditions such as a two-family house or a sub-standard plot existed
prior to the enactment of the present ordinance.
All cases that come before the Board are applications for permits
that have been denied by the Building Department. The Board is for
all practical purposes a court where the citizen may come for relief.
Despite compassionate aspects of a particular case, the Board is
bound by Village Law and local ordinances in its findings. If an ap-plication
is denied by the Board, the matter may then be taken to the
State Supreme Gourt^ — - — --• —
Meetings are held the third Wednesday of each month. State law
requires that each case be advertised so that each property owner
affected may-ha ve-an-opportunity-to protect-his interests.&quot;&quot; &quot;T&quot; ™~ &#x27;&quot;&quot;&quot;

KNOW YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS
Kent G. Thomson, 55 South Side
Avenue, as most everyone in the Vill-age
knows, from the littlest kids to
the senior citizens who participate in
the activities he supervises, is Re-creation
Supt. With a full time staff
of 2 and a part time staff of 100 Kent
boasted 143,638 attendance at various
&quot;rccTeatibnial pur adits&quot; lasit year at a
cost of less than $1. 30 per citizen
per year.
For this the Villagers have their
choice of parks, tennis, teen age
dances, in fa eta choice of over ninety
different activities throughout the
year, ranging from tiny tot to senior
citizens programs.
Born inRye, N. Y. , he received
his B. S. in Physical Education, Health
and Recreation from Ithaca College
and has done post graduate work in
recreation. From 1944-46 he spent
in the Army Air Corps. Kent came
to Freeport as a Recreation Super-visor
in 1955. In March of 1957 he
became Recreation Supt. , the post he now holds.
Kent is president of the L. I. Recreationand Parks Assoc. , a group
withwhomhe has been associated, in various capacities, for the past
five years* He is also a member of the N. Y. Recreation Society, the
American Recreation Society, the National Recreation Assoc. and the
Kiwanis Club of Freeport. The first Christmas ToylandParade in
Freeport in 1959 was an activity he headed as chairman; he was pub-licity
chairman for the J. Russell Sprague Scholar ship Fund Dinner.
A few years back he was a Scout master and later became a commit-tee
member of the Boy Scouts of America.
His philosophy on community recreation is simply expressed--
a welt rounded program which furnishe s healthy diver sionary activitie s
for all groups, young and old. He finds that by cooperating with other
organizations in the community it is possible to offer a broad spectrum
ofactivities at lower cost. Thus the Recreation Dept. workswith local,
civic, fraternal, business and religious groups with this goal in mind.
Kent is proud that Freeport has the broadest program on L.I.
with the lowest budget for the size of the community. He notes that the
program receives up to 40£ per youngster fromN. Y. State for youth
recreational activities and $2000 a year from the Freeport Board of
Education.

FUNCTION OF THE SEWER COMMISSION
The Sewer Commission is authorized by the State &amp; Village law
and its three members are appointed for three year terms by the
Village Board of Trustees.
The Commission is responsible directly to the,Mayor and Board
of Trustees for the proper maintenance and operation of the Village
Sanitary Sewerage System. The system consists of slightly over 100
__mile_s of.main and lateral sewers,:-three pumping stations and the
Sewage Treatment Plant located at the foot of Albany Avenue. These
responsibilities can only be filled with the close cooperationwhich ex-ists
between the personnel of the Sewer Department, the Superintend-ent
of the Sewer Department and the Commission.
The~cost &#x27;of construction of the mains, pumping &quot;station&#x27;s, lind Sew-age
Treatment Plant, and the maintenance and operation of the entire
system is paid for by the Village as a whole. The cost of construc-tion
of lateral sewers is assessed against the properties benefited.
The Sewer Commission can only create a lateral sewer district by
petition of the property owners and only after properly advertised pub-lic
hearings. With the Village approximately 95% sewered, it is im-portant
that the balance be sewered to avoid the danger of creating
health hazards and to satisfy State and County Board of Health regu-lations.
The Sewer Commission is particularly interested in discuss-ing
with property owner s in the unsewered streets, the steps neces-sary
to create a sewer district or districts and proceed with the in-stallation
of the lateral sewers in those areas.
Our Village Ordinance requires that all buildings be connected to
the SanitarySewers, where such sewers are available, by December
3 1, I960.
It is the duty of the Sewer Commission to enforce the Village Ordi-nance
Chapter 2 and the State and County Board of Health regulations
dealing with Health and Sanitation.
Regular meetings of _the Commissionare held the first Thursday of
each month with additional special meetings whenever necessary.

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
Brooklyn claimed Walter J. Brad-shaw,
Park Commissioner and his
wife, the former Maude Blower, un-til
1938 when they moved toFreeport
and have been happy and productive
in our Village ever since. Their son
John W. Bradshaw was graduated
from Freeport schools andfromGor-nell.
Married, he now lives in Sy-osettandhas
one daughter--the apple
of the eye of her grandfolks;
Walt has an inborn fondness for,
children.and a deep concern about
combatting the causes which lead to
juvenile delinquency. He knows much
delinquency actually stems from
boredom and a lack of healthy out-lets
for young energy. Thus he is
strong for parks and supervised recr
reational activities on a broad basis.
He feels that the more children who
are kept busy and interested in nor-mal
entertainment and recreational
pursuits the less time there will be
for the type of hanging around which
so often leads to trouble.
A chief claims examiner in the County Attorney&#x27;s office, and pre-viously
an evaluator in Ind. Div. of the Motor Vehicle Bureau, Wal-ter
has served on the Commission for the past three years. Like
most people he is proud of what we have in Freeport in the way of
parks but wishes it were possible to have more. He says that he feels,
along with Robert Moses, that potential park land once lost to the com-munity
is gone forever.
In a village where every second person&#x27;s main hobby seems to be
fishing, Walt has an unusual hobby. He raises azaleas, not just a-round
the foundation either. Walt owns a plot of ground on Babylon
Turnpike with 6,000 azalea bushes. He started with a small green-
Chouse in his backyard; raised SO-varieties-and-soon-found&#x27;the&quot;azaleas
were literally pushing him out of the house. So he bought the land on
Babylon Turnpike to keep his varied and lovely bushes.
Walt, who naturally advises the Park Commission on landscaping,
and his wife Maude, live at 133 Putnam A venue. After 22 year s in the
village they have seen many changes and much growth but they still
feel it is a great place to live; agreat place to raise children and a
great place to raise azaleas as well. ..that is if you don&#x27;t over do it
like Walt did.
Walter J. Bradshaw
Park Commissioner
KNOW YOUR DEPARTMENT HEAD
Henry G. Ankenmann, better .
known as &quot;Frenchy&quot; has lived in
Freeport in the same house since
1923, at 19 Gordon Place, or per-haps
it should be called LaRue Gor-don,
for Frenchy, who speaks and
reads French fluently, though born
in Manhattan, lives there with his
wife the former Eugenie Gayet, who
was born just outside of &#x27;Paris. Hen-ry&#x27;s
folks were from the French sec-tion
of Switzerland.
Frenchy workedfor the Village in
1930 as an automobile and truck me-chanic
until that position was abol-ished
in 1937. He returned to the
Village service in 1948 and became
Foreman of the Garage in 1949. He
supervises three other mechanics
and one maintenance man and they,
together , service about 140 vehicles
including the .Sanitationtrucks, Vill-age
cars, Police Department vehi-cles,
electric power and other de-partmental
vehicles. The Garage is
open six days a week and they stock numerous parts for all depart-mental
vehicles. So close and careful is their inventory procedure,
that when the Village discontinued using a specific model car, Frenchy
had only two fan belts and two door handles left over for the discon-tinued
model. .
The Ankenmanns met, not in Paris in the Spring, but in New York
City in .the Winter, but romance blossomed and their two children are
married and have children of their own. There is Marguerite Sullivan
who has one child and Henry Ankenmann, Jr. with three children. All
the Ankenmann off-spring live in North Merrick.
World War 1 saw Frenchy, who had enlisted in the New York Nat-ionalGuard,
serving in the Air Corps and in the Infantry and he spent
•n-early&quot;th&#x27;ree-year&#x27;s-over sea&#x27;s &quot;serving in the army of occupeiti&#x27;dn&#x27;.&quot;3&quot;&quot;&#x27;&quot; &quot;
Frenchy is a member of the American Legion and the Freeport
Elks; an Honorary Captain in the Freeport Fire Department, Engine
Company #1; he drives the venerable old steam engine in the local pa-rades.
He has served as Treasurer of this Engine Company for the
pasttwenty years. He is also a member of the Freeport Exempt Fire -
men&#x27;s Assoc. and currently serves as Sergeant-at-Arms.
As to hobbies he used to enjoy dangling a line for &quot;lepoisson&quot;, but
in recent year s he finds his job consuming more and more of his time.

PRESENTING. YOUR .COMMISSIONERS
Connecticut born Stewart M. Hub- .
bell, who is now serving his seventh
year on the Freeport Planning Board,
is a real New Englander as both his
mother&#x27;s family and his father&#x27;s fam-ily
had ancestors who fought in the
American Revolution.
Stewart came to Freeport in 1945
from Pittsburgh but he had been no
stranger to Long Island&#x27;s south shore
as he had lived in Oceanside from 1929
until 1941. But it wars Bristol, Con-necticut
where Stewart grew up and
thenattended Dean Academy in Frank-lin,
Mass. A mechanical designer for
the National Can Company for many
year s he joined the U.S. Steel Corpo-ration
nine years ago and is the Con-struction
Coordinator for the Univer-sal
Atlas Cement Division of that firm.
Mrs. Hubbell, the former Rita
Armell of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and
Stewart met when she was visiting a
summer resort in Bristol, Connect-icut.
Poth of them agree&#x27;that despite
living in other areas of the east, they still prefer Freeport and both of
them hope the village will be able to maintain its present quiet, suburban
character.
Past president of the Northeast Civic Association, Stewart joined
the Planning Board in 1954 and has been active on it ever since. He
lists his hobbies as boating,fishing, and wood working.
Stewart is very proud of his two sons Frank and Paul, both of whom
worked their way through college by playing in name bands. Paul with
Ralph Flanagan and Skitch Henderson and Frank with Preacher Rollo
and his Dixieland group at Miami. Both play club dates on weekends
but both have abandoned the music business for serious careers--Frank,
who lives at the Hubbell home at 183 No. Columbus Avenue works for
Hazeltine Electroncis and Paul, who lives in Merrick teaches at
Deer Park Junior High School. Paul and his wife, Susan have a boy and
a girl.
Stewart points out that there are four generations of Hubbells in
the vicinity now as his father, Ernest, lives on Pine Street in Freeport.
Everyone knowing of the New England traditional traits of common
sense and dedication to liberty will be glad that this small piece of New
England has found itself a pleasant home in Freeport.

James J. Lyons of 29 Coolidge
Place, the superintendent of the Vill-a
ge I. Bi M. operation is an all Free-port
lad no matter how you look at it.
He moved to the Village from Brooklyn
when he was four years oldyvas grad-uated
from Holy Redeemer in 1936 and
then want on to Freeport High where
he was a member of the football team.
He then had to leave the Village
temporarily to take a Bachelor of Sci-ence
Degree in nearby Hof stfa College,
and during World War II he le ft tempo-
&quot; &quot;&quot;rarily for a two and one half year&#x27;stirit
in the Army Air Corp. But his heart
was always in Freeport,in fact Jim met
Vera Piper in the Freeport Village of-fice,
a court ship followed and they were:
married in Freeport in ,1953.
Jim&#x27;s Village career started
promptly after he was graduated from
Hofstra. He became a bookkeeper in
1950and, in 1959, was appointed Super- James J. Lyons
visor of the I. B. M. operations in the Supt. of Village I.B.M. Operation
Village. Proving that a satisfactory -
career in local municipal administration is possible for ambitious
young men; Jim prepared for the supervisory position by attending a
number of specialized schools and courses in electronic computing.
He attended the IBM Basic Machine Operators Course; the Functional
Wiring Principals Course; the Basic Wiring Course in 402-403 mach-ines
and the IBM Course at Endicott, New York.
Proud of the work the IBM unit does Jim is quick to explain how
such computers save a great deal of time and clerical expense for the
Village as wellas furnishing accurate records to guide the planners on
trends within the Village.
Jim is no stranger to municipal administrationas he is the son of
Harriet Lyons, well known to most Freeporters as the recently retired
lady who had served for many years as secretary to the Village Clerk.
Incidentally Jim lives within 2 blocks of the same house in which he
grew up in Freeport.
Vera and Jim are the proud parents of two little girls, Lorettawho
is 6 and Janet who is 5. If they want to keep up their record 100% it
will be their duty to make sure that these two little gals grow up and
marry Freeport boys, but, as Jim points out, this is something you
can&#x27;t quite plan on and something even the fabulous IBM computers can&#x27;t
quite work out for you.</dc:description>

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
If you should be passing John
Collins house at 254 Pennsylvania
and you hear someone declaiming .
&quot;How long, Oh Caesar, will you try
our patience ?&quot; do not become alarm-ed.
It is John practicing his hobby
of translating Latin authors such as
Cicero into English. The erudite
Park Commission Chairman also has
a great interest in a wide variety of
other subjects -- in fact he met his
wife, the former Rita Farnum, while
they were both members of a church
dramatic-society.
Jamaica born John Collins was
educated at Brooklyn Prep and Ford-
&#x27;-ha-m&#x27;University. He spent 10 l&quot;/2 years~
as a Special Agent for the F. B. I.
working in Houston, Texas; Chicago ,
Illinois; and New York City. He con-ducted
a major portion of the inves-tigation-
which led to the apprehension
of Harry Gold, the atom bomb spy and,
subsequently Julius and Ethel Rosen-berg.
He also served on the staff of the Joint Legislative Committees
inNew York andNew Jersey who made a study of wire tapping. Collins
is proud of this work as it was responsible for the wire tapping legis-lation
passed in New York State. : •
John also served on the staff of the Special Assistant to the Attorney
General that conducted an investigation into the conduct of officials of
Suffolk County. And, just to show how versatile John is, he also con-ducts,
locally, a real estate appraisal and insurance brokerage business,
The Collins who came to Freeport.in 1952 after.living-for some years
in Jamaica have three children Michael, a freshman at the University
of Dallas, Maryellen, a junior at St. Agnes High in Rockville Centre
and John Junior, who is in the 6th grade at Our Holy Redeemer School in
&#x27;the&#x27;Village. ,&#x27; &quot;. ..&#x27; •,.-.&quot;&quot;•• &quot;&quot;&#x27;4 V •
&quot;My ambitionas ParkCommi ssionChairman,&quot;John says, -&quot;And one
shared by members of the commission is to continue to improve our
existing facilities and to expand them so that they will be commensu-rate
-with the increasing population in Freeport. Healthful recreation
not only strengthens the body but it refreshes and relaxes the mind and
only through foresight, planning and initiative can we assure that we
will have the proper facilities not only today but in the days, months
and years to come.&quot;
One reason John is anxious to do park planning for tomorrow today
is that he knows the meaning of the Latin phrase tempus fugit.

Freeport born Franklin A. Grem-pel
can still recall with excitement his
boyhood days in the Village when the
. horse drawn fire engines raced down
the streets; the horses hooves strik-
, ing sparks on the cobblestones. &quot;Bud1
Grempel never lost that fee ling --he
and his 5 brothers all be came mem-bers
of the Freeport Fire Department
--Bud for some 39 years--and reached
a lifelong ambition when, in 1953 and
1954 he served as Chief of the FFD.
Twenty years before he had been cap-tain
of Hose Company No, 4.
Bud has lived in the North East
section of Freeport for 40 years. One
..,Of i- i~children;&#x27;&quot;9* of &gt;wholh&quot;a?e~stiir&quot;~&quot;
living, Bud attended Freeport schools
thenafter anapprenticeship as a me-ychanic
became -service manager for
&quot; the Sidney Smith Ford agency a post
he held for 10years. He then owned
his own repair shop until Pearl Har-bor
when he joined the H.O.Penn Ma-chinery
Company servicing heavy duty
. diesel equipment.
It was after the war that Bud came to the Village as a maintenance
mechanic for the Sanitation Department trucks. He left for a while in,
1947, to go with the Michigan Tractor and Machinery Company of
.Detroit. But the pull of Freeport and its many happy associations was
too strong. Bud returned as assistant maintenance foreman of all vill-age
equipment at the municipal garage.
._•_• Bud and Mrs. Grempel, the former Gladys MacCarter of Amma-gansett,
Long Island met in the early twenties and were married in
1923. They have 2 children -- Mrs. Joyce McKinney who lives with
her five children in Greenville, Miss, and son Richard Grempel who
1 ives in Freeport and is employed by the Villageat the Power house
as.a plant operator.
Bud&#x27;s interest in fire fighting reaches into his hobbies too--he does
metal la the work and experiments on new safety devices and equipment
for firemen. He has a patent pending on one of his inventions which pre-vents
fire hose from receiving undue wear,not suprisingly he spec-
. ializes in&lt;fire apparatus maintenance on his job too.
Bud and Mrs. Grempel make their home at 238 Independence Avenut
but you might just find him at any firehouse too.

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
Brooklyn born Van Baar Brown,
of 20 Beverly Parkway, doesn&#x27;t be-lieve
in long jumps when he moves
his residence. He came to Baldwin
32 years ago; met Annabell Sheehan
of Freeport whowas teaching in Bald-win;
married her in 1934 and moved
to Freeport. Even at that he only
moved a hop, skip and jump from the
Baldwin boundary line.
But there is no question as to
where his loyalty lies.He was a char-ter
member and president for three
terms for the Northwest Civic Assoc-iation.
He served on the Park Com-mission
from 1 955 through 1 958 dur -
ing the time that Freeport parks were
being built and its recreation program
--one of the first on Long Island--be-ing
developed. He now serves as Chair-man
of the five member Planning
Board of the Village.
A graduate of St. Ignatius Loyola
grade school; Regis High School. After
Columbia and N.Y.U. , Van went into
the real estate business and later the advertising agency business.
Then, with the repeal of the 18th Amendment, he saw a future in the
wines and liquor business. He introduced Christian Brothers wines into
the New York market in 1938 and GalloWines in 1945. He is now with
the Sales and Merchandising Department of the Gallo Wine Company.
Van&#x27;s son Robert, 22, is sort of following in the old man&#x27;s footsteps
in that he is in the merchandising business also as a manage ment trainee
inthe J.C. Penney Company, the.firstste_p on the_ladder_that could lead-to
a high executive position inretailing. The Brown&#x27;s daughter Kathleen
Ann is a student at the Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia, Penna.
Van&#x27;s service on the park commission contributed to his deep inter-est
in public recreational facilities. Along with leaders inthe American
conservation and public lands preservation movementhe feels that citi-zens
must act now to make certain that sufficient land is set aside for
the recreation and enjoyment of this generation and generations to come.
He believes that only interest by the general public in this question can
help assure enough parks for the future. He is also a strong advocate
of municipal recreational programs for the health and well being of the
entire community.
A strong Freeport booster in looks like Baldwin has, after 32 years,
lost him for good.

CHAIRMAN -- WATERFRONT COMMITTEE
Some of the folks we write up met
their spouses right here in Freeport
but the record for the opposite of that
must go to Michael Wainz, Chairman
of the Waterfront Committee, Born
in Austria -Hungary, Mike met his
wife, the former Joyce Knight of To-ronto,
Canada at a night school course
in Baltimore, Maryland. The Wainz&#x27;
live at 662 South Grove Street, with
their 14 year old son Robert, a bo-sun&#x27;s
mate in the A Hied Nautical Ca-dets.
Their daughter, Patricia Goess
lives inSeafordandhas three childreri0
Michael has owned a boat of his own
since, at the age of 15, he bought his
first one to sail the quiet waters of
Chesepeake Bay. He has sailed out of
Freeport since 1939 although it was
not until 1954 that he and Mrs. Wainz
moved here from Queens. That same
year he went into the boat brokerage
business and turned into a great suc-cess
increasing the area of the boat
bulkhead from40&#x27;to 260&#x27; inthe process.
None who know him is surprised that he is Chair man of the Water -
front Commission and has been since 1958. From 1940 to 194 6 he ser-ved
in the Coast Guard Re serve Class T at Short Beach and Jones Beach
stations. He was commander of the Coast Guard auxiliary in the Free-poct
area from 1947 to 1951 and served in coastal patrol work. He has
boatedfromKey West Florida to the Canadian border. He is obviously
&quot;&quot;at&quot;home on the water.
He is also at -home incivic work; He-is vice president of the Wood-cleft
Association, a member of the Tuna Club of Freeport, the Chamber
of Commerce, the Harbor Civic Association,the Atlantic South Civic
Association, the Marine Trade Association, the Allied Nautical Cadets
and the Around L.I. Marathon Association which brings considerable
publicity to the village of Freeport for its activities.
Among the recommendations of the waterfront committee of which
Michael is most proud are the widening of Woodcleft Avenue; the in-stallation
of mercury lamps on every light pole; the speed limit signs
on the waterways and the launching ramp at the waterfront park.
The greatest natural asset of Freeport is its water front--and one of
Freeport&#x27;s greatassets in preserving that waterfront is the man who
can&#x27;t stay far from the smell of the sea -- Michael Wainz.

Patrick, Beth, Victor and Virginia,,
Ben, a-founder of the Freeport Har-bor
Civic Association is currently
on the Board of Governors,, He has
been a member of the Waterfront

where he served as Senior Information Officer,, He is anactive mem-
&quot;ber of the Knights of Columbus0 When he gets the time,, he can be
found taking flying lessons out of Zahn&#x27;s Airport,,
Ben&#x27;s political philosophy is centered on the fact that every com=
munity is basically a collection of families who want the best available
for them within their means0 However, all planning must be done in
terms not only of the present but the iuture because eventually this will
be our children&#x27;s town0 He recently returned from a trip to California&#x27;
and Hawaii where he made a study of the tremendous rebuilding pro-grams
in both of those areas and was particularly impressed with Kai-ser&#x27;s
modern shopping center, the Ala Moana0 He&#x27;d like to seeasim-=
ilar one in Freeporto
He is very proud of his neighbors who over the past few years have
contributed much to the improvement and growth of Tfreeportandarevit-ally
interested and active participants in the many local civic and f rater -
nal organizations,, He is especially proud of the community tree planting
program carried out by his neighbors and the Freeport Harbor Civic
Association,,
Bernard Abbene
Commissioner -Planning Board
CHAIRMAN - BEAUTIFICATION COMMITTEE
George Isenberg, Chairman of the
vBeautification Committee is one per-
&#x27;; son who cannot go back and visit his
birthplace because they went and built
the George Washington Bridge over it0
Thus he came to Freeport in 1927
where there was no danger of this hap-pening
again,, He was graduated from
the old Seaman A venue School and from
Freeport High where he. was a mem-ber
of the 1935 track team,,
Oldsters may remember when
George, a boy of 13, received a ham
radio operators license, one of the
youngest to achieve this distinction,,
They may remember because they of-ten
received George&#x27;s signals when
they wanted to hear The Happiness
Boys and the Cliquot Club Eskimos on
old W0E0A0F0 So the young Marconi
had to turn to other pur suits „
George was graduated from the
Long Island University College ofPodi-atry
in 1939 and he practiced for sev-
George Isenberg
eral years prior to entering the Army as a private,, He served in this
country and in the Mediterranean theater of operations and was sep-arated
in December 1945 as a first lieutenant with four years of mili-tary
service behind him0 Shortly thereafter he resumed his practice,,
In his role as chairman of the Beautification Committee, George
wants to see more trees inFreeport and more ornamental shrubs,, Few
know it but George was responsible for having the flowering dogwood named
as the official tree of Freeport and he feels there are a few sights as lovely
as this graceful tree flowering in the spring,,
George and the former Mildred Brockhaven of Jackson Heights were
married in 19460 Their daughter Adriane, aged 8, attends the Atkinson
Schoolo They live at 203 Mt0 Joy Avenue,,
George had an unusual hobby-per haps not so unusual in view of his
responsibilities for further beautifying Freeporto He collects dwarf
plants and he has an amazing collection of over 60 varities of azaleas,
weeping dogwood, birch, spruce, hemlock and others that only a horti-culturist
would even know existed,,
&quot;My goal0&quot; George says &quot;Is to get folks more interested in the
appearance of the whole community and not merely their own property
and I also want to do more imaginative landscaping around our public
build ing So Every one benefits when a village becomes more attractive
and good landscaping is one of the keys to this,, &quot;</dc:description>

His was a life of zeal for God and for Man and his anselfish devotion

A MOTOR VEHICLE BUREAU RELEASE
A Branch Office of the County Motor Vehicle Bureau was estab-lished
inFreeport during the year 1926, located at 88 Church Street,
Freeport, Long Island, under the supervision of the Long Is land Auto-mobile
Club. This office was officially taken over by the County of
Nassau on April 27th, 1931.
The Freeport Branch Office is one of four Branch Off ices located
in Nassau County, namely Hicksville, Valley Stream and Manhasset,
whose function is to issue Passenger, Commercial, Suburban and
Trailer license plates; also reregistrations, that is, transferring
plates from one car to another car in the same name and renewing
Operator and Chauffeur licenses, the exception this year being that
Suburban plates have been discontinued and we :now issue standard
series license plates for Passenger cars and Station Wagons.
All Branch Offices are under the direct supervision of the main
office in Mineola and the County Clerk, Francis J. Anderson, is the
Agent for the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.
The I960 license plates will be continued in use for the year 1961
and the 1961 registrations will be validated by the issuance of a num-bered
metal tab to be affixed to the rear license plate.
The Freeport Branch Office is presently located at 149 West Mer-rick
Road, Freeport, L.I. and is in charge of our Branch Office Man-ager
- Harold F. Siegel. This office as well as our other Branch Of-fices
is equipped to give over the counter service only.
During.the year 1959 the Freeport Office issued approximately
73,000 sets of license plates; 15,100 reregistrations and renewed
approximately 16,000 Chauffeur and Operator Licenses.
The dead line for Commercial and Trailer registrations is Jan-uary
16th and for Passenger and Station Wagons -January 31st, 1961.
In accordance with a new law, effective May 31st, 1961 all Chauf-feur
Licenses must be reclassified. Chauffeur licenses expiring May
31st, 1962 and May 31st, 1963 will be reclassified during the months
of Fejjr^ajry and Marj^h. A^U ^
1961 will be reclassified and renewed during the months of April and
May, 1961
Harold F. Siegel, the Manager of our Freeport Branch Office is
ably assisted by amiable, always smiling Henry Herr, one of Free-port&#x27;s
finest committee men.
PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONERS
Benedict P. Ciaravinb, born a
stone&#x27;s throw from the village, in
Baldwin, probably can claim a Free-port
record in that he is a member
of a family of 9 children all of whom
were graduated from Freeport High.
Ben, a member of the Planning Board,
now resides at 17 Pear sail Avenue
having come over from Baldwin four -
teen years ago.
Ben attended Cornell, Hofstraand
Brooklyn Law School and received a
Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psycho-
1 ogy and his Bachelor of Laws degree.
He is also just a plain bachelor as
well but, at 36, there is still a pretty
good chance that some Village maiden
may yet catch his eye.
A singer inamateur musical come-dies,
a boating and fishing hobbiest
and a golfer Ben, who maintains a law
practice at 8 West MerrickRoad would
scarcely seem to have time for civic
services but he gives freely of him-self
as evidenced by the fact that he
is a past Commander of the William Clinton Story Post of the Amer-ican
Legion; Exaulted Ruler of the Freeport Elks; a member of the
South Nassau Bar Association and active in numerous charity drives.
And that is only part of it. He is alsoChairman of the Nassau Coun-ty
Legion Legal Committee; a member of the National Legion Com-mittee
on Military Justice; Legislative Chair man of the William Clin-ton
Story Post of the Legion, a member of ^he Nassau County Legion
By Laws Committee.
There&#x27;s an old saying that when you want something done, ask a
busy man. Ben is a living embodiment of that for he also serves as
Navy Recruiting Officer of the Naval Reserve Surface Division 3-63
of Freeport. This is a direct result of his service not in one, but in
both wars, World War II and Korea. Ben served on aircraft carriers
as communications officer; gunnery officer and legal officer. He was
graduated from the Naval Justice School and now holds the rank of lieu-tenant
Commander in the U.S0 Naval Reserve. And, oh yes, he also
serves as Republican Committeeman in the 48th District.
When does he get time for those hobbies he lists?
Frankly we don&#x27;t believe he ever does&#x27;.

PRESENTING YOUR COMMISSIONER
A &quot;young old-timer&quot; is the way
Samuel L. Iselin, newest member of
the Park Commission, refers to him-self.
Sam, appointed to this post by
Mayor Glacken to fill out the unex-pired
term of David Kadane who re-signed
from the Commission, has
been a Freeporter practically all of
his life. He went through the Free-port
school system, took an LLB at
Dickinson Law School where he was
a member of The GracchiHonor Soci-ety
and a, member of Phi EpsilonFra-
Samuel L. Iselin
Park Commissioner
Sam practiced law in the village
until World War II came along and he
served honorably in the Armed Ser-vices
for three year s, being separated
with the three up and one down stripes
of a staff sergeant.
Business, civic and compassionate
might be the three major interests of
Sam outside of his home and family.
He is very proud that, during his term
as President of the Freeport Community Council the Senior Citizens •&#x27;
Group was activated and Sam feels that this touching concern of the
community for the dignity and well being of its older citizens is a
mark of a sound civic character. His civic interest has revealed it-s
elf in the factthat he is a former Vice President of the Freeport
Chamber of Commerce and a former Vice President of the Atlantic
South Civic Association. And business? Director of Sales of the Patty
Petite Division of Kay Dunhill, Inc. , in New YorkCity, a family con-
- trolled business. --- . ._ . —
Sam is frankly delighted with his Park Commission appointment for
this&#x27;is not his fir st&#x27;tirrie &#x27;around. He had &quot;previously served on this com-mission
under Mayor Cyril Ryan with Branch Rickey Junior and Everett
C0 Fur man. A firmbeliver in park developement Sam feels the Park
Commission has done a fine job in the past and will continue tp?do sc
in the future. ,•
Loyal to the village all the way Sam is married to a Freeport gal
the former Milderd Kalban. They live at 112 Front Streetwith their
91/2 year old daughter Susan0 Sam says he plays a little golf but his

FIRST PUBLIC STATEMENT BY MAYOR ROBERT J. SWEENEY
(From speech at Organization meeting of A.pril 3)
MAYOR SWEENEY : Ladies and gentlemen:. The dust of our recent
campaign has settled and the people of Freeport have passed judg-
. ment on the parties and the candidates. The election is over and we
must once more re-unitefor the good and benefit of our Village. The
election emphasized our political division, as it must do, for to vote
;is to divide, and in selecting one candidate or one party we must nec-essarily
reject the other,
The fact is however, we are Freeporters first, last and always, I
hope the day never comes when the things that divide us, such as the
past election, become more important than the things that unite us -
the interests, the rights and the opportunities of all of the people of
Freeport, , .

********&gt;! ******************
ELECTRICIANS MUST BE LICENSED _
All electricians who wish to do any work in Freeport must be li-censed
by the village. This is&#x27; a &#x27;requirement of the ordinance which
is administered by the Master Electricians Licensing Board estab-lished
in 1953.
There are 195 electricians presently licensed by the village. This
includes many out of town concerns as well as Freeport individuals and
organizations. Twenty -five new licenses were issued in the past year.
To assure work which is safe and up to the proper specifications
the ordinance will be strictly enforced.
Standards vary among towns and villages. A Freeport license in-dicates
the electrician knows Freeport conditions and is fully quali-fied.
The ordinance is not directed at home owners who are competent
to do their own electrical repairs and installations ( in their own
homes only and not including any commercial establishment).
However, all installations, alterations or additions require a Fire
Underwriters Certificate after completion. To arrange for inspec-tion
and approval contact the Village of Freeport Electrical Depart-ment.
CHILDRENS SUMMER PROGRAM
Freeport&#x27;s summer playground program will begin on Monday,
June 26, and continue each Monday through Friday throughout the sum-mer,
terminating on Friday, August 18. A schedule of summer play-ground
events can be obtained by contacting the Freeport Recreation
Department in the Village Hall, 46 North Ocean Avenue.

The zoning ordinance of the village has been changed to limit
apartment building to only two zones: Residence Apartment and
Business AA.
A public hearing was held on May 15, when the Village Board
heard the views of residents, civic association representatives,
real estate organizations and affected property owners. By unan-i
mous vote, the Board restricted apartments to thetwo zones,which
make up approximately four per cent of the village; previously apart-ments
were permitted in zones which comprise approximately 33
per cent of the land area in Freeport.
***********************
ALL VILLAGE LAWS ,UNDERGOING REVIEW
A committee appointed by Mayor Sweeney and the Village Board
is presently at work studying all village laws and ordinances. This
committee of attorneys will make recommendations to the Board for
repeal of obsolete or unenforcable laws and for enactment of new
JL egislation. _.... ..._
Chairman of the Law Review and Revision Committee is M. Sabin
Thaler. The other members, all attorneyswho reside in Freeport,

STREETS TO BE IMPROVED
The Highway Department has the streets listed below on its cur
rent schedule for improvement or repair. There are many other
streets which need attentioi, and those will be scheduled in a sys
tematic way to get the best possible use of Highway Department per •
sonnel, equipment and funds.
1. Archer St., Park to Brookside
2. Summers PI.
3. Gill Avenue
4. Remsen Avenue
5. Powell St.

PARKING METERS CHANGED
As a first step in a program of proper control and limiting of
parking meters, the Village Board has established a uniform clos-ing
time for meters on all streets and in all parking fields.
Meters will be in effect only until six p. m, in all locations .
Previously the closing time ranged from six p. m. to ten p. m. in
various streets and fields.
Periodically, the Police Depart ment will issue &quot;courtesy&quot;
warnings instead of tickets to parkers who have unintentionally
over-stayed their time by a few minutes.
The change in metered time was made on the recommendation
of the Parking Field and Meter Committee, under the chairmanship
of Mr. Milton Danziger. This committee is making a continuing
study.
Theatre-goers can help assure the success of the program by
using the parking fields in the evenings instead of the streets, al-lowing
others proper access to the stores during shopping nights.
BICYCLE SAFETY
The warm weather brings a large increase in the number of
bicycle riders0
Under the Bicycle Safety Program of the village, police of-ficers
will be on the alert for any cyclists who are riding double,
failing to use hand signals or otherwise not following the rules of
the road.
The youngsters will be stopped and told about these infract-ions,
for their own safety, and if there is a repetition the par-ents
will be advised.
Safety instructions and additional tests for the issuance of
new licenses will be held in the fall.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WHERE CREDIT IS DUE
Beautification of the grounds surrounding any building
in the village enhances not only that property but also the
entire community.
Freeport can be proud of the attractive grounds of
many of the village&#x27;s fine homes, business establishments,
churches, other public buildings, etc. (Unfortunately, it
is not possible to mention all by name without inadvert-ently
omitting some.)
All those who thus contribute to the beautification of
the village deserve great credit for their civic leader ship .
Your attention is invited to these landmarks of good
community relations.

CONSIDERING SALE QF VILLAGE OWNED LAND
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney^ahd the Village Board of Trustees are
considering a proposal to sell at public auction a parcel of land owned
by the village. The purpose of the sale would be to add the value of
the property to village income and to the tax rolls. At present the
land is not being utilized by the village and is not providing any tax
revenue. A preliminary study indicates it is not suitable for devel-opment
as a recreational site.
The property is located at South Grove Street and EastAvenue, a
triangular plot. It is approximately 297 feet on Grove Street, 327
feet on East Avenue and 183 feet on the south boundary. Zoning is
Residence AA. The designation is: Sec. 62, Blk. 77, Lot 1. An ap-praisal
of the property has been ordered by the Board of Trustees.
If a final decision is made to sell the property, further notice will
be giveninthe press. Also* anyone inter ested in purchasing the prop-erty
may advise the Village Clerk of his interest, in writing, and; no-tTcV:

PUBLIC MEETINGS
The Village Board has set pub-lic
meetings for the third Monday
of each month, in July, August and
September.
In other months of the year pub-lic
meetings are held on the first
a nd third Mondays of each months
Meetings begin at 9 p. m. at the
Village Hall, 46 NortlvOceanAve-nue.
INSTALLING A FENCE?
A permit from the Building
Department is required to in-stall
any fence which would be
considered a &quot;structure&quot;&#x27;under
village ordinances.
To avoid any expensive or
inconvenient changes, please
consult the Building Department
before you purchase or build.
MAN&#x27;S BEST FRIEND DESERVES PROPER SUPERVISION
There have been many complaints concerning dogs running loose,
ruining gardens, menacing children and otherwise causing a nuisance
or a hazard.
These dogs are not wild animals without homes or masters. They
are the pets of otherwise responsible citizenswho havebeen careless
about proper leashing or fencing.
For the sake of respecting the neighbor s1 rights and property, and
for the pet&#x27;s sake, all dog owners are asked to control their dogs,
keep them from running loose, use a leash when walking the dog and
curb him. .
Perhaps the dog doesn&#x27;t know any better, but certainly all dog
owners will want to observe the rules of good citizenship and good
neighbor lines s.
STATE RAISES FEE FOR DOG SEIZURES
The village is required by law to charge the owner a fee to redeem
any dog which has been seized while running loose.
The law is administered by the Department of Agriculture, and
the village merely acts as a collector of fees.
A recent amendment of the law raises the fee for each seizure
from two dollars to five dollars.
The law states:
&quot;The owner of a dog seized may redeemthe dog within three days,
if the seizure bewithina city, and withinfive days if elsewhere within
the state, by producing to the per son seizing the dog a license for the
dog and by paying to the clerk the sum of five dollars as the cost of
the seizure. &quot;
It is inconvenient as well as expensive, because it is necessary
.for .the&lt;dog&#x27;s owner to travel to thedetention center, inW a ntagh-to--re-deem
the dog.
THE SUGGESTION BOX
During the summer months windows are open and sound travels
unrestricted into nearby homes.
It will be appreciated by the neighbors if the volume on the radio
and television sets is kept down to a reasonably low level, particu-larly
at night.
(If you have any suggestions for The Suggestion Br-x, please address
them to: Monthly Bulletin, Village of Freeport, 46 North Ocean Ave-nue.
)
&quot;CLEAN-UP&quot; IS ON REGULAR SCHEDULE
Instead of a yearly &quot;clean-up&quot; campaign, the Sanitation Depart-ment
will pick up rubbish and bulky material on a regular basis.
Garden debris and rubbish placed in proper containers, and ma-terial
not in excess of 100 pounds, properly secured, is to be put out
at the curb and will be picked up on the same day that household gar-bage
is collected.
If garbage is collected on Monday and Thursday, rubbish will al-so
be picked up on Monday and Thursday. If garbage is picked up on
Tuesday and Saturday, rubbish willalso be picked up on Tuesday and
Saturday. Therefore, each residencewillhave two pick-ups a week.
Bulky material such as furniture, refrigerators, stoves, large
tree limbs, etc., will be picked up the day after resident calls the
i ncinerator at FR 8-4000. Calls can be made on Monday through Fri-day
from 8:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. ; also on Saturday (for Monday pick-up)
by calling FR 8-4005 from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon.
Residents may also call the above numbers whenthey return
home from vacation, so that the Sanitation Department can resume
regular pick-up of garbage.
CRAB-APPLE, DOGWOOD AND ... ?
The Beautification Committee, under Chair man Mr. Jerome Tier -
man, is considering revisions to the tree planting ordinance. The
ordinance specifies that only crab-apple or dogwood trees may be
planted at the curb.
This ordinance was originally enacted to eliminate problems
caused by trees becoming entangled in overhead wires or harming
water and sewage facilities underground. The Beautification Com-mittee
is now looking into other species of trees which might alsobe
suitable for .curb planting.
VANDALISM
The parks and recreation facilities of Freeport are for the enjoy-ment
of all residents. Unfortunately, there has been for some time
a problem of vandalism in our parks.
This represents not only an unwarranted expense to every tax-payer
but also a potential decline in recreation services. To com-bat
vandalism and provide greater protection the Park Commission
and the Village Board are attempting to have park personnel on hand
for as many hours as possible, seven days a week. Also, police call
boxes are being installed in a central location in each park, and po-lice
officers will make regular tours through the parks on their
rounds.</dc:description>

ABOUT SWEEPING
Storekeepers are ad-vised
that police will
enforce Ordinance 7. 3,
which bans sweeping
dirt, paper and other
unwanted materials
from the sidewalk into
the street. Litter or
other debris must be
placed in watertight,
covered receptacles for
collection. Village au-thorities,
knowing that
most merchants take
pride in having a clean
business area, are de-termined
to help keep
it that way.
STATE MAY. BUILD BOAT-LAUNCHING RAMP
The Village Board has under consideration an
arrangement with New York State whereby a
boat-launching ramp (mechanically operated)
would be installed by the State on Albany Ave-nue&#x27;s
east side between the incinerator and the
sewer plant, along with a two-acre parking
field on each side of the street. After 10 years
the village, which provides land for this $100,&quot;
000 improvement, can exercise its option to
buy it. No objection to resulting traffic is ex-pected,
since the site lies in an industrial zone
a short distance south of Merrick Road.

plaque, was pre-sented
in mid-July to
Mayor R o b e r t J.

Chief Peter Elar at a
ceremony in the may-or&#x27;s

indicated that
pedestrian injuries
last year totaled only
32, compared to 52
during the preceding
year, giving Freeport
a rating near the top
among American com-munities
with popul-ations
of from 25, 000

The local police
scored a full 100 per

HALF AS OFTEN;
ARE YOU FOR IT?
Would you like to re-ceive
only six electric-ity
bills per year, in-stead
of one each month
is at present ?
A plan to send fewer
bills --with resulting
economies for house-holders
as well as the
village--is under con-sideration.
The ben-efits
would include sav-ings
on check,or-.mon-~T.-
ey order fees, postage
and envelopes, besides

(Cont&#x27;d. on Page 4)
SUGGESTION-OF-THE-MONTH
In the railroad station area, drivers are urged to obey all traffic
signs. These regulations will probably change from time to time be-cause
of the new conditions resulting from the extension of Railroad
Avenue, new parking fields and re-location of bus stops in conjunction
with the track-elevation project.
Safe drivers recognize the importance of obeying one-way street
markers. Important also, for safety&#x27;s sake, are parking regulations.
CHURCH STREET 59 YEARS AGO. The Spanish cannon, presented
to Freeport in 1902, was a new comer to the corner of Main and
Church Streets when this photo was taken, looking &#x27;southwest.
Schwab&#x27;s Tavern (extreme left) stands at a spot about where Sunrise
Highway now runs through. Trolley tracks came down Main Street,
linking western Nassau to Brooklyn. A light snowfall made the
trolley tracks easy to see.
FIRST SCHOOL STOOD ON TRIANGLE
(Supplied by Freeport Historical Society)
Our first school house was built in 1820 at the triangle, Main and
Church Streets. A one-story room, approximately 18 by 22 feet „
had pineboard desks fastened to the walls.
In winter the hours- fro.m-8-a.m. to noon .and from.- L p...m..- until 5
or 6 p.m. were broken only by two 10- minute intermissions. On Sat-urday
the children went home at around noon.
The &quot;Gay Nineties&quot; saw Freeport take a vast stride forward. Three
great improvements were gained in 1893: a modern school (the fourth
one we had), still in use at Grove and Pine Sts. , the establishment
of a water department, and formation of our fire department to
strengthen Excelsior Hook &amp; Ladder Company.

MAILING URGED EARLIER IN DAY TO SPEED SERVICE
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney is honorary chairman of a new Citizen
Advisory Committee which will try to reduce the&quot;,&#x27;&quot;&#x27;after 5 P. M.
rush of mail at Freeport&#x27;s Post Office.
Faster service and greater efficiency are expected if local peop
cooperate in this campaign, aimed at encouraging business estab-lishments
as well as residents to mail letters and packages in the
morning or early afternoon. At present the post office is deluged
daily with 70% of the total mail volume coming in between 5 and 10
p. m.
Postmaster Ralph L. Marshall has named Bernard Fixler of Crea
tive Mailing Service as chairman of the committee which also in-cludes:
Bernard Ames, Columbian Bronze Corp.; Henry Meyer ,
Milton C. Johnson Co.; Joseph Sellecito, Weksler Instrument Corp.;
Leonard D. B. Smith, Village of Freeport, and Arthur Weiner, Un-iversal
C. I. T. Credit Corporation.
Freeport was one of 250 communities in the United States chosen
for such a program. At a luncheon in the Sea Breeze Restaurant
last month 15 major business-mailers got the campaign off toa good
start after hearing a talk by William. F. McDonough, regional space
requirements officer.
SANITATION DEPT. IMPROVES PICKUPS
A year-round &quot; clean -up;: pro gram is under way, through improvi
service by the Sanitation Department.
Pickups of garden debris and rubbish, not in excess of 100 pound:
are made twice a week on the same day that household grabage is
collected.
Garden debris and rubbish, properly secured, must be placed at
the curb to qualify for collection.
Bulky materials such as furniture, refrigerators ( with doors re-moved
) large tree limbs, etc. , will be picked up the working day
after a resident calls the incinerator at FR 8-4000. On Saturdays
the special number to call (for Monday. service) is Fr. 8-4005 from
8 a. m. to noon.
PRELIMINARY^ SURVEY ON REHABILITATION.ORDERED
Raymond &amp; May, consultants, have been employeedby the Villag*
Board at a cost of up to $ 1,500 to make a preliminary survey and
recommendations in connection with a possible long-range improve
ment plan. The consultants will advise Freeport officials astowhicl
of three Federal plans it considers best for the community.
This action followed selection of Raymond &amp; May by the Planninj
Board, which considered many applicants. Next--if Mayor Sweeney
and the Trustees find that public sentiment is favorable--would com
a master plan based upon surveys of such elements as land use, con
munity facilities, traffic circulation and local needs. The Federal
and State governments would pay most of the cost, regardless of
whether Freeport chose Urban Renewal, Comprehensive Renewal or
Neighborhood Rehabilitation. The Village could reject all three.</dc:description>

Every parent can help, by teaching children to respect the value of
park facilities. Police make frequent visits, but the best antidote for
silly, costly destructiveness is a desire of youngsters to preserve
equipment purchased to increase their fun.

LIMITS ARE 2% STORIES OR 32 FT.
Regulations to end what Mayor Robert J.
Sweeney called &quot;the mushrooming of too-big

unanimously by the Village Board.
The stricter zoning, effective Sept. 5, fol-lowed
a rush of applications from builder s eager
to get permits under the old ordinance. One
week before a public hearing there were 20
apartment houses either .under construction ,
granted permits or awaiting approval of their

Before he opened the hearing to discussion,
for and against, Mayor Sweeney said that near-ly
a year earlier, last autumn, &quot;when it first
became apparent that the Village Party was en-tering
the March I960 election, much publicity
was given that we were opposed to the continued
unrestricted construction of apartment houses, &quot;

MERRICK ROAD DEVELOPS LATE
(Supplied by Freeport Historical Society)
Eighteenth century Freeport had very few streets. If a farmer
chose to travel east or west, the only routes availablewere either on
Main Street north to Hempstead, or east along Broadway (then Crook-ed
Road) to&#x27;H ernp stead -Babylon Turnpike, or~southward-on Main Street
to Mill Road where he could turn eastward.
Merrick Road developed comparatively late. It was at first called
&quot;Fulton Street&quot;. A restaurant and bar on the corner of South Main
Street had such noisy customers that the Presbyterian Church moved
from a close-by site to its present location on Church Street.
Further south, along Freeport River, stood oyster houses owned
by planters whose dredges hauled in loads of the succulent bivalves,
so large and delicious they made our community famous.

age Board turned down

Avenues after a public
hearing.
Instead, Mayor Robert
J.Sweeney and the board
adopted practically all
the suggestions offered
in a plan offered by 31
merchants of the busi-ness
area. The meas-ures
include:
A ban on parking for
70 feet on Atlantic Ave-nue&#x27;s
south side, west
of Bayview Avenue ; a
white line in the center
of Atlantic A venue,veer-ing
toward the curb at

180, 000 gallons bought for this purpose

Sellers of various brands had an oppor-tunity
to bid on three months &#x27; supply in Sep-tember.
There will be tests of its function-ing

in recent years.
SCHOOLS OPEN — DRIVE CAREFULLY I
After opening the local &quot;School&#x27;s Open--
Drive Carefully&quot; campaign, Police Chief
Peter Elar issuedfour safety hints to driver s
at this season. He suggested:
(1) Compliance with all traffic lights; (2)
Obeying &quot;stop&quot; signs at schools; (3) Halting
behind parked school buses when their flash-ing
red lights are on to indicate that the bus
driver is picking up or discharging passen-gers,
and (4) Special care while driving in
school areas and near parks or playgrounds,
where &quot;speed should be regulated to allow
ample margin for a sudden stop should it be
necessary.&quot;
•Hundreds of children are walking to and
from school, many for the first time,&quot; he
said. &quot;While police and civilian crossing
guards have returned to duty, many children
cross at unprotected corners.&quot;

SUGGESTION-OF-THE-MONTH
Police are taking special note of hedges and other plants that grow
too high at street intersections. These barriers to the view of auto
drivers can cause serious accidents.
If you live on corner property, here&#x27;s your chance to practice good
citizenship. Mrs. John Parthey writes: &quot;Let us not wait for a serious
accident to happen when just a few snips off the hedge will give drivers
a chance to see speeding cars.&quot;

NEW POWER COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED
The Village Board appointed a new Mun-icipal
Board of Water and Light Commission-ers
at the public meeting September 18th.
It was found that the utilities board had
never been properly established with a res-olution
of the Village Board, as required by
law. In April, 1955, when the first water-light
commissioner s began operating, indi-viduals
had been named to serve but the board
itself was not properly pSit into effect.
The present Village Board therefor e has
legally for med a new Commission.
Mayor Sweeney had previously requested
the resignations of some member s, express-ing
a wish to appoint .individuals chosen by
the new V-i-llag-e B oa r d, ina smuclva s th e V ill -
age Board must make all major decisions
concerning Fr eeport utilities. (The commis -
ioners act asadvisors to the Village Board. )
The resignations were not given.
The new Commissioners include:
A. William Hindenlang, Chair man, five-year
term. For merly associated with power
plant operations in the midwest; currently
Technical Editor of a trade publication in th*
combustion and power engineering field.

POLLUTION BAN EXTENDED TO 1,500 FEET FROM SHORE
Water &quot;litterbugs&quot; within 1,500 feet of shore are subject to penal-ties
under anamendment of Ordinance 8. 2 adopted by the Village Board.
Acting upon a request from waterfront residents, the board extend-ed
beyond village limits a ban on the depositing of any sewage, refuse
or other offensive materials by boats.
In a letter to Mayor Robert J. Sweeney the waterfront residents en-closed
a New York Times clipping which pointed out that New Jersey
acted promptly and decisively to stamp out a threat to its rnulti-mil-lion
dollar coastal resort industry. Garbage and other polluted mat-ter
on resort beaches had cost that state thousands of dollars in a few
weeks. .• -_^ __ _. . , &#x27; . . • . &#x27; &quot; &#x27; • • ;- &#x27;&#x27;•&#x27; - : : . • &#x27; „ - • &#x27; . . &#x27; / • &#x27; •
The .Tetter &quot;a a id&quot;, in &quot;part: &quot;W e who live on &#x27;the waterfront in&quot; Fr ee-port
have a similar problem. The owners of cabin cruisers have lit-tle
respect for us who live here and ha.ye homes , on the .water. It is
very discouraging to purchase a home, put money in it, and then have
someone&#x27;s garbage come in with the tides. . . It makes for a distaste-ful
situation in many ways.. .
&quot;We believe you should take immediate action to cure this situation,.
Fines should be levied. . . We believe there should be a patrol of the
canals, especially where there may be dockage rented by commercial
boat dealers. Anyone guilty of dumping beer cans, bottles, bags of
garbage, etc., should be given a substantial fine... Let&#x27;s try to keep
the village beautiful by eliminating garbage from our canals.&quot;
FOR A CLEAN FREEPORT. PUT OUT RUBBISH ON COLLECTION DAYS
Without realizing it, many of our neatest families become first-class
litterbugs. They get that way simply by putting garden debris
and rubbish out at the curb on the wrong day of the week.
Let&#x27;s face it -- some people aren&#x27;t complying with the new Sanit-ation

NEW MAILING SCHEDULE FOR BULLETIN
The Village&#x27;s monthly public information bulletin, in a new design,
is being distributed in two stages each month. Half the residents will
receive the bulletin with their electric bills ; the other bulletins will
be mailed separately as a &quot;bulk&quot; mailing. They will be alternated
each month, so that you will get thebulletin as an enclosure one month
and as a separate mailing piece the following month.
This is made necessary by the recent change in sending electric
bills. As an economy measure the Village is billing for electricity
every two months instead of every month. On the new bi-monthly
billing it is estimated that savings will be about $ 10, 000 each year in
reduced postage, meter reading and clerical cost. &#x27; &quot; &quot;

TWO YEAR TERMS OF OFFICE ?
Mayor Sweeney and members of the Board of Trustees wish to get
an expression of public opinion on the question of two-year terms of
office vs. four-year terms for the Mayor and Village Board.
The two sides of the question are : do the residents of Freeport
wish to have an opportunity to vote upon their representatives in vill-age
government every twoyears, or do they feel that two years is too
short a time for a Mayor or Trustee to demonstrate the full effective-ness
of his programs, ideas and abilities?
Most communities in Nassau County elect their governing bodies
for four-year terms. However, one village recently restored two-year
terms. County and Town Supervisor s are elected every two year s.
It is hoped that all organizations of the village interested in civic
affairs will study this important question, inform their members on
all of the pros and cons, and make their recommendations to the vill -
age Board. Mayor Sweeney is also considering a post-card poll of all
residents within the next few months.
If any change is madeitwill not affect the present Mayor and Board,
who are serving four-year terms, because the law could not be made
retroactive.
The next village election will be March, 1963, when two Trustees
will be elected.
***
POWER PLANT PROBLEMS GETTING INTENSIVE STUDY
Mayor Sweeney and the Village Board have directed the new Free-port
Board of Water &amp;nd Light Commissioners to make a thorough
study of our utilities and plan for improvements and more profitable
operation, projecting these plans for fiveand ten years. Village Trus-tee
Frank W. Somers has been assisting the commissioners in estab-lishing
operating procedures and policies. Some of the areas being
studied are;
1. Feasibility of generating more than the present 20 to 30 per cent
of our electricity ( the balance is purchased by the Village from the
Long Island Lighting Company.)
2. Establishing an operating budget. (The plant has not had a budget
and therefore has not been able to project income and expenditures
over a long period of time.)
3. Possible immediate action to increase profits.
Among these possibilities are:
(A) Use of lower cost fuel oil for existing engines. In September,
for the first time, the Village purchased a quantity of fuel oil by means
of competitive bidding. A three-months test is now being conducted
on the lower cost fuel. If the test is successful the administration ex-pects
to realize a savings of many thousands of dollars annually.
(B) Close scrutiny of maintenance costs. These costs over the
years have been very high as compared with those of similar plants
in other communities. This has been reflected in a high cost per kil-owatt
hour of electricity produced.
A initial step was taken in October to clarify responsibilities and
lines of authority in the power plant. Mr. .Charles Boden. was given,
the title of Superintendent of Power Plant, responsible for power
generation and related functions. Mr. Charles Whitty was designated
Superintendent of Electrical Distribution, responsible for the distrib-jutipji_
sy_ste.m .throughput .the, village.

FREEPQRT COMMUNITY CHORAL
A Ilfirst&quot; for Freeport is being produced by the Freeport Commu-nity
Choral on November 30 at the high school. The choral group of
70 voices, a non-profit Freeport organization, is doing the &quot;Creation&quot;
by Joseph Haydn, not in the general concert form but with complete
staging and orchestra.
***
SANITATION DEPARTMENT HAS MANY PICK-UPS
Sanitation crews have responded to more than 3, 000 calls since
April for individual pick up service on bulky items, according to
Harry Chuisano, Superintendent of Highways &amp;: Sanitation.
Under the new program begun this year, residents can have bulky
materials picked up at the curb by calling the Sanitation Department
(FR 8-4000) on the day before their regular pick up in that area.
The Sanitation Department also provides regular pick up service
for business establishments in the village.
***
INCINERATOR STUDIES
Residents of the Colony Park and Bay Estate areas have called
attention to the problems of smoke and ash from the incinerator area.
This complaint was first noted someyears ago, and the cause has
been the inadequacy of our incinerator for the volume of refuse picked
up in the village or otherwise delivered to the dump.
The new administration is now studying the feasibility of building
an addition to the incinerator or otherwise eliminating this problem
which has plaqued the southeasterly part of the village intermittently
for several years.

NEW FAST, ACCURATE DEVICE TESTS METERS
An electric eye is testing watthour meters for the Freeport Elec-tric
Dept0 since the arrival of a new States test table with automatic
controlSo In the picture, Robert Grogan, supervisor of electrical
services ( seated) gives instructions to an assistant, Ivan Asher0
Formerly an operator had to start the meter&#x27;s revolving disc in
accurate timing with a &quot;rotating standard&quot;, count tha revolutions and
stop everything at the proper memento Ofter he needed to repeat all
this a few times for accuracy,, But now a photoelectric beam of light,
focused on the meter&#x27;s revolving disc, shines through ahole each time
the hole spins past a sensitized cello This gives precision as well as
speed to the testing,, , . .
Mr0 Grogan says that each meter is tested first at 10 per cent of
capacity and then 100 per cent0 The meter&#x27;s holder can be movedfor-ward
or back for convenient inspection,,
Addition of this device to the tester already in use will enable two
men to make testa at the same time0 This provides increased eff i -
ceincy needed to test the more than 12,000 Freeport meters period-ically
after they are installed, as well as when each comes from the
factory and just before it goes into service. The Public Service Com-mission
requires Mr0 Grogan or an assistant to test each .business
meter every one to four years, according to its kilowatts-amperes,
and .systematically do the same for each residential meter every eight
year So . ... . • ... . . ; . . • . . : . :.. :.
Each test table contains, a master meter which the PSC, tests for
accuracy at least every three months,,

CITIZ ENS&#x27;&quot; GROUP TO KEEP&quot;POSTED
ON RENEWAL PLANS
A citizens&#x27; committee of Freeport civic leaders has been appoint-ed
by Mayor Sweeney to keep the residents of the village informed on
the administration&#x27;s plans for general neighborhood renewal.
Known as the Citizens&#x27; Committee on Community Planning, the
group will meet regularly with the chairman of the Planning Board,
E. Richard Fortunate, and other public officials to discuss the vill-age&#x27;s
plans for renewal of substandard residential and business areas.
Warren G., Schubert is serving as the Mayor&#x27;s representative and
chairman. Other members are: • ...

obtain complete answers to any questions which might arise .
PROPOSED BUDGET REQUIRES TAX INCREASE
The Village Board has presented a tentative budget
for fiscal 1962-1963 totalling $2, 588, 539.12. After de-ducting
estimated revenues other than real estate, and
appropriations from cash surplus, the amount to be raised
by taxation would be $1,890,639. 12, necessitating an in-crease
in the the tax rate from $2.20 to $2.49 per $100
of assessed value .
This would mean that the owner of a home assessed at
$5,000, for example, would be required to pay an addi-tional
$14,50 per year.
In submitting the budget Mayor Sweeney stated that
certain obligations could, not be put off any linger and had
to be met this year. He said that he was confident the ad-ministration
would be able to reverse the upward trend in:
costs of services and materials and bring about a tax re^
duction in the next fiscal year, by employing sound manage-ment
policies to curb expenses and by obtaining greater tax
revenue from the business community through a continuing
program of spurring business development. He cited four
budget, categories which required increases this year:
(.1) An increase of $70,000 for the Police Department,
to add four additional men and to adjust salaries to meet the
Nassau County schedule. (2} An additional sum of $61, 000
for village employees l salary increases and benefits. Approx-imately
half of this amount is a mandatory payment into the
retirement fund. . f3) An increase of $55, 000 to meet 1962-
1963 obligations on maturing village bonds, far bond issues
authorized&quot; in previous years. £4)- € An added $24, 000 for the
Sanitation Departmentr-to-make-up for a deficiency in funds
allotted for personnel services in the previous year.
Mayor Sweeney indicated that budget requests of the var-ious
departments added up to a tax increase of almost 40
cents, but by carefully scrutinizing every item the Village
Board pared the total to 29 cents.
He also established a new policy of providing all inter -
ested civic groups with a detailed 94-page schedule showing
costs of all items in every department. In past years only

HOUSING PROJECT BIDS OPENED
When this Village News went to press, the Freeport Housing Au-thority
was opening bids on the Senior Citizens Housing Project at
South Main and Raynor Streets. This will be Long Island&#x27;s first Fed-erally
financed Senior Citizen project,
Meanwhile at its first meeting the Authority elected John B«. Mack,
chairman; Judge Moxey A. Rigby, vice-chairman, and Philip Nickels-berg,
secretary; Dr. George Isenberg; received.approval as land-,
sea ping, advisor..
Letters seeking admission to the South Main Street home center
may be sent to H. C. Williams, the Authority&#x27;s executive director,
at his office, 30 Albany Avenue, Freeport, although all decisions on
admission of applicants mustwaituntil the project is nearly completed.
Many persons have r-.irea* Applied.
In a park-like atmosphere, five separate buildings will contain a
total of 50 dwelling units ranging in size from small apartments to
two-bedroom units. There will be a community room, about 20 by
30 feet, for social affairs, meetings, etc.
Construction will probably start as soon as the freezing weather
is past. It is hoped that the first occupants will move in within a year
or so later.

ELECTION TO BE HELD MARCH 20
The law requires Freeport to vote.March 20 on a Police Justice to
fill the unexpired term of Paul Kelly, who resigned when he became
County Judge. Former Village Counsel Edwin J. Freedman was ap-pointed
to the Police Court post for the first three months of this
year, but the voters must decide who will occupy the bench for the
balance of the term ending in April, 1965. Names of all candidates
were not known when Village News went to press.
Because an election is mandatory anyhow, our community has an
opportunity to cast ballots without extra expense on two propositions.
Elsewhere in Village News will be found further information concern-the.
Gbw Meadow and two-year term issues.
Mayor Sweeney said:
&quot;I was elected on a platform, pledge to submit major decisions to
the voters by public referendum. While this is a departure from
procedures previously followed in Freeport, I strongly believe that
the public should make such major decisions. Cow Meadow is im-portant
becalisV:of&#x27; its significance5TtTthe future physical develbp&quot;menf&quot;

Shall Mayor&#x27;s, Trustees&#x27;
Terms Be 2, Not 4, Years?
TWO YEARS OR FOUR YEARS?
The vote March 20 on two-year or four-year terms for Mayor and
Village Trustees arises from the following situation:
Originally the shorter terms existed. The former administration,
by permissive referendum -- not public vote -- changed them to four
years. The new Village Party administration believes that tenure of
office should not be decided by the people elected to office, but by the
voters who put them there.
Included with the proposal on the ballot will be a plan for putting
two-year terms into effect in such a manner that the entire Boardwill
not come up for re-election during the same year.

ECONOMIES AHEAD ON TWO FRONTS
Good news for taxpayers:
A safety committee made up of Police Captain Edward S. Dixon,
chairman, and all Freeport governmental department heads has dras-tically
reduced claims for workmen&#x27;s conpensation. If the scarcity
of serious accidents continues, our insurance bill for the next fiscal
year will drop.
The cost of automobiles and car and truck repairs is also due for
a cut, under a plan just introduced in the Municipal Garage at the sug-gestion
of Mayor Sweeney, A program of servicing motor vehicles
regularly, through a modern records system, show promise of sav-ing
on repairs and in addition lengthening automobiles&#x27; useful life.
* * *
CLEAR HYDRANTS, PLEASE!
Fire hydrants surrounded by ice and snow will delay the work of
firemen in an emergency. Homeowners are urged to cooperate by
clearing the space around hydrants.
. . . * * * • . .
ELECTION TO BE HELD MARCH 20 ~ .-;--.-.

as well as the tax structure of Freeport. The two-year versus four-year
tenure of office is important because of its bearing onFreeport&#x27;s
future government. I shall be guided by the public&#x27;s vote on these
matters.&quot;
A qualified voter who has once registered under permanent regis-tration
is thereafter entitled to votewithout further registration if his
home-address remains unchanged and if he or she votes at a general
election at least once in each period of two successive calendar years.
If the voter moves to another location within the SAME election district,
he or she maynotify the inspectors on Election Day. But if the new ad-dress
is OUTSIDE his or her election district, re-registration is nec-essary
on Registration Day, March 10.
Voting qualifications will appear in the next Village News.
COW MEADOW PROPOSITION
Shall Cow Meadow, 164 acres of meadow land just outside the
southeast corner of Freeport, be acquired by the village for park
or recreational use? That is a question up for decision March 20
by local voters.
Cow Meadow is zoned at present for industrial use. At a sche-duled
hearing Jan. 2 by the HempsteadTown Board to consider re-zoning
the property for residential use, the area was withdrawn
from a South Shore upzoning plan. &#x27;:&#x27;.:
More than 100 Freeporters, led by Mayor Sweeney, carried pet-itions
to the Town Hall and had nine speakers ready to protest the
rezoning. But before the hearing began, Presiding Supervisor Pal-mer
Farrington announced he had learned&#x27; from the Mayor that Free-port
intended to hold a public referendum ori the question of acquir-ing
Cow Meadow. The Town Board quickly dropped the upzoning
from consideration.
The owner of this property has started an action in Supreme
Court requesting a declaratory judgment changing the zoning to res-idential.
Foes of home development on the land at the foot of South Main
St. warn that it would add many thousands of dollars each year to taxes.
The area lies within School District No. 9 although it is outside the
village limits, on a peninsula accessible from the upland only through
South Main Street.
Purchase or condemnation of Cow Meadow, preferably with the
aid of Hempstead Town funds if possible, was advocated by a citizens&#x27;
committee made up of presidents of the local civic associations and
school district and business leaders. A detailed report on the com-mittee&#x27;s
fact -finding and recommendations will be made available for
public study. . .
The property is appraised at from $ 1, 400, 000 to $2, 050, 000, de-pending
largely upon whether town officials zone it for industry or
homes. These estimates do not include fill, bulkheading or other
possible improvements for recreational purposes.

NEW ONE FOR THE ROADS0 Highway Department&#x27;s new &quot;Backhoe,&quot;
with Motor Equipment Operator Julius Ellison at controls, prepares
to dig trencheSo By facing other way a driver can use same vehicle
to load road materials or pick up leaves or snow0
THE VILLAGE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT
In variety of services Freeport&#x27;s Highway Department probably
rates near the top of the list. Maintaining 110 miles of roads is a
principal job, but many of the department&#x27;s 32 men have other assign-ments
ranging from signs to snow removalo
&quot;For example,&quot; said Harry J0 Chuisano, &quot;drainage problems
naturally are referred to the Highway Department A special crew
is assigned to keep catchbasins clear by using an &#x27;orange - peel &#x27;
cleaner, with fingers opening like the peels of an orange, to close
again around leaves and debris0 The same crew cleans drainpipes
by dragging cable through the interior,, Autumn, with its avalanche
of leaves, complicates the task of drainage maintenance0
&quot;One of our community&#x27;s most versatile groups is the Maintenance
Division which builds drains, lays pipes, does minor building &quot;job&#x27;s
and paints public buildings0 &quot;
Vehicles suited for more than one job find a warm welcome0
That&#x27;s-why-a &quot;Backhoe&quot; was purchased recently to dig trenches-for-drainage
-- or, when colder days come along, to pick up leaves or
remove snow by using a front-end bucket loader,
&quot;Keeping the streets clean is another important function,,&quot; Mr0
Chuisano continued,, &quot;Two mobile power-sweepers are used on roads
that have gutters installed0
&quot;The Sign Division&#x27;s work requires a blend of art and common
sense0 In a village like Freeport the painting, repair and replace-ment
of old signs is a big job in its elf „ If you add to this the making
of new signs (they must be designed also), you get some idea of how
heavy a workload this unit carries0 Street-name poles, traffic direc-

MORE POWER FOR THE SEWER COMMISSION
Sanitation ranks among the most important of all municipal activ-ities.
But unlike electricity production, water, parks and sewers,
the sanitation program in Freeport is carried onwithout the guidance
of a citizen commissibn.
The Village Board feels that the Sewer Commission&#x27;s responsibil-ities
should be expanded to include the Sanitation Department, there-by
bringing into use its ability and experience gained through its ef-fective
work under Chairman Edward M. Voelker.
Asa technical matter, to expand the commission&#x27;s authority, the
Board must abolish it and then set up a Municipal Board of Sewer and
Sanitation Commissioners. There will be a public hearing March 26
at 9 P. M. on abolition of the Sewer Commission to make way for its
re-appointment, enlargement and added juristiction over the Sanita -
tion Department.

election at least once in each period of two successive calendar years. If the voter moves to another
location withis the SAME election district, he or she may notify the inspectors on Election Day. But if the
new address is OUTSIDEthe election district, re-registrationis necessary on Registration Day, March 10.
QUESTION NUMBER ONE:
COW MEADOW; ACQUISITION
&quot;Shall that certain tract of land situate in
the Town of Hempstead, commonly known as
&quot;Cow Meadow&quot;, be acquired by the Village of
Freeport for park or recreational us eat a price
not to exceed $1,400,000?&quot;
COW MEADOW represents some of the last-re-maining
open land in this ar&#x27;ia. Those favoring ac-quisition
of it by Freeport point out that it would take
care of our park and recreational needs for years
to come. At the same time, public acquisition would
prevent objectionable private developments on the
land, and also eliminate the possibility of homes
that would bring heavy increases in school tax rates.
Opponents feel that an income-producing develop-ment
such as Long Island Lighting Company would
provide income without putting a burden on the
schools. There is also a feeling that purchase of
the land by Freeport would involve a large expense
without compensating advantages. These three major
possibilities are discussed briefly below:
ACQUISITION BY FREEPORT:: Freeport would not
pay over $1,400, 000. The tax rate on this full sum
would be 16.8 cents per $100 of assessed valuation.
However, it is expected that Federal aid to the ex-tent
of 20% could be obtained, reducing our outlay
to $1, 120,000. and the tax to 13. 44 cents. Thefirst
phases of developmentwould be accomplished with
existing fill, village equipment and village labor,
slowly and economically. Mayor Sweeney has stated
that if the public votes for acquisition, the cost of
acquiring the land PLUS development costs will not
be allowed to exceed 19 cents of tax rate during any
year of his administration. Acquisition cost would
reduce steadily for 20 years, finally becoming zero.
PRIVATE HOMES: The land owner is in court now,
seeking 6, 000 square foot zoning for homes. This
is the use the owner most ardently desires, and the
one that can be expected if acquisition is not approv-ed
on March 20. The result would be 790 homes,
1224 school-age children, and immediate school tax
increase of over SOcents per $100 of assessed valu-ation.
The Freeport School System would be re-quired
to provide schooling for children from Cow
Meadow homes, because this entire area is within
our School District No. 9. !
LONG ISLAND LIGHTING PLANT: LILCO would
1 ike to acquire Cow Meadow as the site of a 1, 000, 000
kilowatt generating plant. While the plant would pro-duce
heavy taxrevenue and would send no children to
our schools, strong civic opposition has been express-ed
to such a development. All but one of Freeport1 s
Civic Associations have opposed this use. The main
argument against is that a generating plant with four
450-foot smokestacks, four 12 story-high generators,
acres of coal stock-piles, oil storage tanks, barge
docks, conveyors, smoke and other attendant factors,
would destroy the desirability of Freeport as a place
to live for many of its residents.
YOUR VOTE will determine whether Freeport seeks
to acquire Cow Meadow and control its future devel-opment;
or whether the private owner develops it
with homes, a LILCO generating plant, or some oth-er
industrial development.
QUESTION NUMBERTWO:
SHORTER TERMS
&quot;Shall the;Village of Freeport adopt a local
law changing the term of office of Mayor and
Village Trustees from a term of four years to
a term of two years?&quot;
If the people decide to return to a two -year
term a plan will be adopted to avoid having the May-or
andallfour Trustees elected the same year. This
procedure follows:
Election of two Trustees, in 1963, would be for
four years as at present. Election of a Mayor and
two Trustees, in 1965, would befor a term ofthree
years. Thereafter, all elections to these offices
would be for two-year terms.
BALLOTING ON MARCH 20 IS &quot;ADVISORY&quot;
The voters are being asket to give &quot;advice&quot;
to the Village Board, by their votes on the two
questions, In both cases, the reguired legal
action can be takenONLYby the Village Board.
The public votd has no legal significance. But
it will have very real significance in influenc-ing
the votes of the Trustees and the Mayor.
These questions represent the true workings
of our American system of representative
government in action.
POLICE JUSTICE WILL BE ELECTED FOR TERM ENDING IN APRIL, 1965
State law requires Freeport to vote at this time on a Police Justice to complete the unexpired term of
Paul Kelly, who in January became County Judge by appointment of Governor Rockefeller. The success-full
candidate will be chosen to serve until April, 1965. Because an election is required anyhow, quali-fied
residents have an opportunity, without extra cost to the village, to cast ballots letting the Village
Board know their opinion on questions of importance in Freeport1 s government and tax structure.</dc:description>

COW MEADOW BOND REFERENDUM VOTE MAY 19
The Village Board, voting unanimously in open meeting on April
16, authorized a bond resolution for a sum not to exceed $1,400,000
for the purpose of acquiring Cow Meadow for park and recreational
purposes. Freeport taxpayers will vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; on this ref-erendum
on Saturday, May 19. This is no longer an advisory refer-endum
as the original vote was to be, but the decision of the voters
will be mandatory and binding upon the Board. •. - •
If the vote on the bond issue is &quot;Yes&quot;, the legal machinery will
then be activated to proceed with condemnation, which is the only way
in which the Village would beable to buy the land sihce it lies outside
Village boundaries. If the vote is&quot;Nd&#x27;f the owner is then entitled to
put his land to anylegaluse hedesires. He is currentlyin court ask-ing
that it berezonedfrom industrial to 6,000 square foot residential
plots so he can build houses on it and, though it stillwould not be part
of the Village of Freeport, all children from such homes would go to
school in School District #9 which embraces most of the Village.
All polling places will be open on May 19 from 7&#x27;A. M. to 6 P. M.
In order to vote, a person must&#x27;beproperly registered either for the
annual Village election or under permanent personal registration,
meaning he is at least 21, has been a citizen for 90 days, has lived in
the State one year, in Nassau County four months and in the Freeport
election district in which he is to vote for 30 days. HE MUST ALSO
BE A PROPERTY-OWNING TAXPAYER IN THE VILLAGE OF FREE -
PORT, LISTED ON THE LAST ASSESSMENT ROLLS. This is re-quired
in all bond refer endums. If in doubt as to your voting status for
this election, you may check with the office of the Village Assessor,
Leonard D. B. Smith. There will be no special registration day for
this election.

Cow Meadow Vote —?_ cont. :
A number of residents have pointed out that, since the Village-hired
appraiser made his estimate of Cow Meadow&#x27;s worth at approx-imately
$1,400, 000, • the owner has been selling and removing fill from
the property,, Obviously this has changed the net value, and voters
are assured that the figure of $1,400,000 is the MAXIMUM amount
they are asked to approve. Before any purchase through condemna-tion,
further surveys are made through the courts, andany decrease
in value -- such as has taken place with the sale and removal of fill--
will be the basis of an adjustment. The ultimate amount to be paid
rests with the courts.

NO OTHER-QUESTION ON MAY 19 BALLOT
i &#x27; •
Because of legal technicalities, the question regarding a return to
two year terms or a continuance of four-year terms for Mayor and

and the Department of Audit and Control with a view toward placing
the question on the next annual Village election ballot. Asc Mayor

SPOTLIGHT ON FREEPORT&#x27;S WATERFRONT
You may have noticed the Freeport is proudly billing itself as the
&quot;Boating and Fishing Capital of the East&quot; , and it is no idle boast,
thanks to the energetic work of many people throughout thecommun*
ity. Businessmen of the waterfront, for example, are running edu-cational
advertisements in New York newspapers under this slogan,
pointing out our waterfront facilities and restaurants and advising that
&quot;Everything That&#x27;s Nautically New Can Be Found in Freeport&quot;..
The Village Waterfront Committee has started a Canal Clean-Up
Campaign. Did you know that there are Village Ordinances regarding
dumping of trash from boats or from shore that, if violated, can cost
you a hefty fine? They provide that there shall beno discharge of toi-let
and no deposit of &quot;sewage, offal, ashes, garbage,waste or other
offensive or rejected materials either from shore or fromany undocu-mented
vessel into any waters within or bounding the Village to 1500
feet from shore&quot; andthatthe &quot;owner, lessee or occupant ofwaterfront
property shall keep same cleaned and in good repair&quot;. Too many peo-ple
do not seem to realize that trash in the water is not only unsightly
but actually dangerous to health and can damage boats. Holdthattrash
and help keep our waterways clean!
Freeport will again have international recognition as a waterfront
community and boating center when the Fourth Around-Long -Island
Marathon is held here on July 11th. Boats in this gruelling contest
start and end in Freeport. Watch for this event!

FREEPORT TO CELEBRATE BIRTHDAY

HAVE YOU BROKEN A VILLAGE ORDINANCE LATELY?
Most citizens are not knowing lawbreakers, but almost anyone can
--and does--occasionally violate an ordinance inadvertently, through
ignorance or carelessness. Here are a few that are currently on the
&quot;most-broken&quot; list:
1. Dumping debris into waterways (or even letting grass clippings
fall in from the edge when cutting your lawn. Penalty; Up to $100.

It was recently announced that the Village&#x27;s fire insurance &quot;key
rate&quot; for commercial and industrial properties has beenreduced from
29 cents to 26 cents per $100 and the fire grade improved from Class
5 to Class 4. The dwelling rate, which is based on the fire grade, im-proved
from Class &quot;B&quot; to Class &quot;A&quot;, the lowest possible rate for pri-vate
dwellings.
An inspection of Freeport&#x27;s fire defenses was made during April
and May by the New York Fire Insurance Rating Organization, at no
cost to the Village, Among the factors considered in classifying the
Village were: dependable method of handling fire alarms; ability to
supply water for fire fighting; strength and efficiency of the fire de-partment;
scope and enforcement of building, fire protection and el-ectrical
codes; construction, size and congestion of buildings. .
As a result of the re-classification, Freeporters will qualify for
fire insurance at a lower cost than in the past. It is suggested that
residents and businessmen bring these facts to the attention of their
insurance brokers and agents.

2. PARKING At Residence, Many homeowners don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s
against the law to have more than 3 cars parked on the premises;
anything more than 3 cars must be in a garage, on the street or
in a parking lot. Don&#x27;t park cars on the lot area in front of your
house, either. Fine: Could be up to $100.

aids Freeport in two ways^ by making your house easier to find and by

&quot;The Boating and Fishing Capital of the East&quot;
-August,-1962
COW MEADOW PURCHASE TO BE DISCUSSED AUGUST 20
Once again Cow Meadow and the question of whether or not the Vil-lage
should acquire the land for public recreation purposes (as defined
by law) will be in the limelight. This time it is the open meeting of the
Village Board to be held Monday, August 20, at 9 P. M. in the Confer-ence
Room of the Municipal Building. Everyone interested in this mat-ter-
is invited to be present and to enter into the discussion.
As you know, the election previously planned was banned by the
Court. Acting upon the suggestions of the.Court and a Manhattan law
firm specializing In bond referendum&#x27;s&quot;, Village.Counsel has prepared
three new resolutions regarding Cow Meadow. It is these r&quot;esolutions
which will be discussed on August 20.
The first resolution would authorize the Village to acquire the land,,
and this must be passed by a unanimous vote of the Board. If passed,
the second resolution would be voted to authorize the issuance of serial
bonds in the amount of $1, 330, 000 and capital notes in the amount of
$70,000, to pay for acquisition. The third resolution would then call
for a special election (referendum) in which Freeport taxpayers would
vote whether to approve the bond and capital note resolution. If passed
the Village Clerk could set the machinery in motion for a special elec-tion
to be held the latter part of September, after schools have opened
and most residents may be expected to have returned from vacation trips.
Cow Meadow comprises approximately 164 acres lying outside the
Village at the foot of South Main Street. It is privately ownedand is zon-ed
industrial, but the owner has petitioned the Town of Hempstead for a
zoning change to residential with the expectation of building houses on
6, 000 square foot (minimum) plots; it could, hold as many as 790. Child
ren of families in thesehomes wouldattend schools in District#9, which
most of Freeport&#x27;s children attend. The appraisal figure of $1,400,000
upon which the Village acquisition bid is predicated was based on the pre-sent
industrial zoning, a change toresidential zoning would increase the
cost.
(more)
COW MEADOW (Cont&#x27;d.) ; . ,
This amount is not necessarily what the Village would have to pay,
however, for the Court sets the price in condemnation proceedings and
many factors enter into the final appraisal. It has been adopted by the
Board merely as the maximum figure it would be prepared to pay, if
t h e voters s o ordain. , . • - . - . . -
In any event, YOU areFreepprt, so come out onAugust 20 for this
important meeting and help make a. decision which cannot help being of
far-reaching consequences to the&#x27; future of Freeportfor many years to
come-.
VILLAGE GEARING FOR BIG BIRTHDAY PARTY
It has been decided definitely to have a gala birthday party in mid-
October in recognition of the 70th anniversary of the incorporation of
the Village of Freeport. Trustee Frank Somers is coordinating chair-man
for the event and a committee of volunteers, drawn from the more
than 50 persons who attended a recent meeting, is now working with
the Village publicity and public relations committee to draw up- specif-ic
dates and plans for events to be included.
Major goals of the Village-wide celebration will be: to acquaint
newcomers in the community with the historic past and interesting
traditions of Freeport; to preserve artifactsand memories of our cul-tural
heritage in this rapidly -changing community; to bring together
every age from all corners of the Village in a bond of friendship and
mutual endeavor for the good of the community.

<dc:description>FIRE DEPARTMENT OFFERS SPECIAL HELP TO INVALIDS
TheFreeportFireDepartmenthas launched &quot;Operation Emergency&quot;
to offer special assistance to invalids and others who might nee.d aid
in leaving burning buildings. All information, which is confidential,
will be kept in a card file so responding firemen will know in advance
that a person must be evacuated from any specific address. Also,
the Fire Department will place a sticker at the front window of each
such house and another on the window of the room where the invalid
person sleeps, to assist firemen in their rescue work. If there is
anyone in your family who should be on these emergency rolls, please
notify the Fire Department, Box 777, Freeport.
WARNING; DON&#x27;T BURN LEAVES ON STREETS
Fall and falling leaves are synonomous, and leaves on the ground
mean bonfires to manyFreeporters. However, the Village Board re-minds
all residents that there is an ordinance against burning leaves
in the streets. Most of the streets are now black -topped, and burning
on this surface damages the streets considerably. It is thennecessary
to make repairs--an added expense which eventually shows up in our
taxes. Even in the few miles of streets which still have dirt or gra-vel
on the edges, burning leaves canbe dangerous to cars, to passers-by
and to property. If you have too many leaves to use as mulch and
can&#x27;t give them away to friends in treeless areas who want to use them
as mulch, try to wait for the sanitation pick-up. The Village is now
working on the problem of those with excessive leaf loads and hopes to
announce a disposal solution shortly.
LET US APPLAUD
* The Police Benevolent Association, celebrating its 3 5th anniversary
of aid to the Freeport Police Department and the community is con-ducting

* All those who became new citizens this year, by coming -of -age or

FREEPORT HISTORICAL FESTIVAL &amp;&#x27;PARADE OCTOBER 20-21
The Freeport Historical Festival, with the theme &quot;Salute to the
70th&quot;, will open with an Historical Parade on Saturday, October 20,
and will include an Historical Exhibition in Randall Park on October
20 and 21, all in honor of the 70th anniversary of the incorporation of
the Village of Freeport. In addition, there will be special events
planned by the Memorial Library, the Historical Museum and a gala
dinner sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce under the chairman-ship
of Judge Paul Kelly. This is the latest word from the Festival&#x27;s
General Chair man, J. Norman Leek, who extends a cordial invitation
to every individual and organization in the Village to join in making
this a truly memorable occasion.
Although the entire theme is historical and the Festival Exhibition
will, of course, contain many educational aspects, there will be plenty
of light-hearted moments for the whole family during the Festival.
The parade will be colorful with floats, bands, antique cars and cos-tume
groups. At Randall Park there will be brightly-colored tents,
bands playing, jand, a^mong displays of historical documents and photo-graphs
there will also be old-time diversions like pie-eating contests
and barbershop quartette singing.
To make it possible for families to spend as long as they want at
the Exhibition, a huge clam bar will be set up and operated by mem-bers
of the Waterfront Committee and various waterfront merchants;
it is impossible to have a complete old-fashioned clambake but steam-ers,
clams-on-the-half-shell, corn-on-the-cob, clam chowder and the
like will be offered at reasonable prices. The entire Festival is plan-ned
as a non-profit, non-commercial Village wide celebration, with
no admission fees and nothing to buy except food.
Anyone having any suggestions for the Festival or Parade, or wish-ing
to participate in any way, is urged to contact Chairman J. Norman
Leek, Trustee FrankSomers or Publicity Director Dee Kratovil at the
-more-
Festival &amp; Parade Cont&#x27;d.
Municipal Building, or get in touch with the appropriate committee
chairman listed below. It is hoped that everyone in Freeport--and
friends and former residents as well --will participate in the Fes-tival
and that young and old will learn to appreciate the traditions of
Freeport while having a good time.
Chairman J, Norman Leek appointed the following committee
chairmen: Parade, Kent Thomson; Historical Documents and Coor-dination,
William Morin assisted by Mr. and Mrs. William Kaland
and Mrs. William G laser of the Historical Society; Field Location and
Layout, RodVandivert and Jerry Schliefer; Waterfront, Paul Humbert;
Band Concert, Mrs. William Martin and Mrs. HaroldBattin; School
and Youth Participation, Mrs. Benjamin Sh,ebar and Mrs. Roy Caccia-tore;
Special Events and Programming, HaroldHeld and John Wark ;
Policing and Protection, Capt. Edward S. Dixon; Safety, Fire Chief
Ben Cooke. Seymour Gross is special funds treasurer, Marge Enders
is secretary and DeeKratovil, with members of the Village Publicity
and Public Relations Committee, is handling publicity.
The line of march for the parade and a complete list of events and
displays will be published in the October issue of the Village News
and in local newspapers. But mark your calendars now so that the
week-end of October 20 will find your and your families all ready to
enjoy the &quot;Salute to the 70th&quot;.
WATCH THAT BOAT SPEED! OBEY FOUR-MILE LAW!
With more pleasure boats and fishermen enjoying the waters of
&quot;The Boating and Fishing Capital of the East&quot; there has come an in-creasingly
serious problem on the canals and waterways around Free -
port, and it&#x27;s spelled S*P*E*E*D.- Too many people are not paying
attention to the legal speed limit of four miles per hour. As a result,
there has been heavy property damage to boats, docks, bulkheading
and waterfront property. Worse, many lives have been endangered.
Increased patrols by County Marine Police on the waterways and by
Freeport Police ashore have been authorized, but this is not the ans-wer
to the problem.
First, watch your own speed when in a boat. Four miles an hour
is like &quot;a slow stroll&quot;. The wash from your boat&#x27;s wake should swish
gently and harmlessly against other boats or the shoreline, not leave
boats frantically bobbing after you pass. Secondly, report the num-bers
of offending boats to the Police to help enforce the ordinances.
The boat you save may be your own!
*****
UNITED FUND DRIVE OPENS-ELEVEN AGENCIES BENEFIT
STOP Wasting Your Time. . . LOOK At All the Facts,.. LISTEN
To Good Sound Counseling.. .ACT After Considered Judgement.
That&#x27;s the slogan for the 1962 campaign of the United Fund, of
Freeport, Inc., which will be officially launched during the month of
October and which, this year, will benefit eleven different Freeport
agencies.
One contribution will cover all of these and eliminate separate
drives for each. It also benefits the agencies involved, for by having
one drive for all, it cuts down on repetition and unnecessary expenses,
making more actual funds directly available. All monies collected in
Freeport are earmarked for use in Freeport.
These agencies are included: Red Cross; Association for the Help
of Retarded Children; Boy Scouts; Girl Scouts; Cerebral Palsy; Fam-ily
Service Association; Mental Health Association; Salvation Army;
South Shore Child Guidance; U.S.O. , and, new this year, The Ber-man
School.

The Freeport Fire Department has launched &quot;Operation Emergency&quot;
to offer special assistance to invalids and others who might nee.d aid
in leaving burning buildings. All information, which is confidential,
will be kept in a card file so responding firemen will know in advance
that a person must be evacuated from any specific address. Also,
the Fire Department will place a sticker at the front window of each
such house and another on the window of the room where the invalid
person sleeps, to assist firemen in their rescue work. If there is
anyone in your family who should be on these emergency rolls, please
notify the Fire Department, Box 777, Freeport.
FIRST USE OF STATE JDAON L. I, ... When Governor Rocke-feller
established a State Job Development Authority with$50, 000, 000

Freeport is the first on L. I. , the second in the state to qualify for
JDA funds and assistance. You&#x27;ll be reading a. lot about the new in-dustrial
park to be established on ten acres of newly filled land back
of the Stadium. It is expected to provide many new jobs and will add
more than $3, 000, 000 in assessed valuation to our tax rolls.

&quot;SALUTE TO THE 70TH&quot; PROMISES TO BE BIGGEST FETE EVER
Freeport1 s Anniversary Celebration October 20 - 21
Even though the reservations aren&#x27;t all recorded as we go to
press, the Freeport Historical Festival and Parade, &quot;Salute to the
70th, promises to be one of the biggest events to take place in the
Village for a long time. You&#x27;ll have to watch the local newspapers
for last-minute details, but here are the plans in brief.
PARADE. ..The Parade will start at 10:15A.M. sharp on Satur-day,
October 20, according to chair man -Kent Thomson. The route
is: from Junior High School grounds atGrove and Pine to Little Pine

Park, where the participants will disband after passing in review be-fore
Mayor Sweeney, the Board of Trustees and other dignitaries.
Although the line of march cannot be announced until all reservations
are in, there willbefrom three to fivebands, a large group of anti-que
automobiles, many decorated floats and costume groups on foot
or ;in- vehicles&quot; to make the parad-e-a-eolor-ful-one^—Each-unit^will be
in its proper chronological order in the parade to carry out the his-torical
theme. Thefloats, antique cars and other interesting vehic-les
taking part in the parade will be on display as part of the Histor-ical
Exhibition at Randall Park.
EXHIBITION. . .Randall Park will be the site of the Historical Ex-hibition,
which will be open from 11 A. M. to 10 P. M. on Saturday
(displays only till 7) and from 1-6 P.M. onSunday. The Village will
sponsor a large tent which will serve as a focal point, with smaller
tents and displays fanning out from it in a mall leading toward the
bandstand, where special events will take place throughout the week-end.
In this tent will be a display of photographs, documents, maps
and other memorabilia tracing the history of Freeport with the accent
on the events leading to incorporation 70years ago and the progress
-more-
of the Village since that date. This tent will also have a display
arranged by the Freeport Historical Society.
Among the many groups and organizations participating in the
Festival will be Girl Scouts, who will have an encampment; United
Fund; Freeport Public Schools; Freeport Memorial Library; Reg-ular
Freeport Democratic Club; Atlantic South, Colony Park and
Northwest Civic Associations; Antique Car Club of L. I. ; Freeport
Fire Department, Freeport Police Department, including demonstra-tions
of the work of the new K-9 Corps dogs and men; Athena Club;
Garden Club; Inter-faith Clergy; Kiwanis Club and Chamber of Com-merce.
A number of other groups, including other civic associations
and many veterans&#x27; groups, are expected to participate but have not
yet filed their plans with the committee.
FOOD. .. The Waterfront Committee, in cooperation with business-men
of the waterfront area, will be on hand throughout the Festival
to serve up refreshments at a huge Waterfront Clam Bar at theSouth
end of Randall Park. This is the only place you can spend any money,
for everything else in the Festival is free, and chairman Paul Hum-bert
promises that reasonable prices will prevail in the spirit of the
non-profit, non-commercial celebration. At present, it is planned
to serve clams on the half shell, clam chowder, grilled hot dogs, hot
coffee and Coca-Cola, so everyone in the family should find some-thing
to his taste.
EXTRAS. . . Parents with small children will be glad to know that
there -will be free babysitting service during both afternoons of the
Festival, in the play area at the southeast corner of Randall Park.
Grirls Scouts are donating their services and there will be adults on
land.
A number of special events are planned during the Festival. The
Library is planning a Walking Tour to points ofhistoric interest in
the Village . It is hoped to have band concerts and other musical
;reats taking place from time to time on the bandstand, while the
Antique Cars will take part in various contests, with local merchants
donating prizes. The Girl Scouts will have aCampfire Sing Saturday
night from 7-8. There will be a Square Dance on Saturday 8-10 P. M.
it Randall Park, with everyone invited and admission free. Watch
your newspapers and listen to WGBB for further details.
SOUVENIR PAPER... The Village Publicity and Public Relations
3ommittee, in cooperation with THE LEADER, is preparing a spec-ial
souvenir edition of the newspaper which will be mailed to every
lome in Freeport the week preceding the Festival. This will feature
/arious aspects of Freeport1 s history and will contain many photo-graphs.
Editor Eddie Vasil and the publishers of THE LEADER are
lonating this space to the 70th Anniversay Committee and deservea
/ote of thanks from everyone for the fine gesture.
SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPER... The gala wind-up to the &quot;Salute to the
70th&quot; will be an Old-Fashioned Sunday Night Supper to beheld thefol-
-more-lowing
week, October 28, at 7 P. M. at the Elks Club under the spon-sorship
of the Chamber of Commerce, with County Judge Paul Kelly
as chairman. Only a limited number of tickets will be available and
are expected to go fast, as prices will be very low. Reservations
may be made through Mrs. Harold Battin at the Chamber of Com-merce
office.
IN CASE OF RAIN. . . The Parade and Exhibition will be held on
October 27-28 at the same timss and places in case we have bad luck
with the weather. If you&#x27;re in doubt on October 20, listen to WGBB
for any change of plans.
CREDITS... There are so may people expending their time and
effort to make this Festival a success that it is impossible at this
time to list them individually, but we hope they know that the Festival
Committee and the officials of the Village are deeply grateful for
their dedicated cooperation. J. Norman Leek is general chair man for
the whole celebration and is doing an inspired job. The news media
have all been most cooperative in helping publicize the Festival and
bring the story of Freeport to thousands of persons, and therewill be
more to come, we are told. Thanks, too, to Nassau County for let-us
use the lovely bandstand.
SO COME ON, FREEPORTERS, HAVE FUN AT THE FESTIVAL!
BIG THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN FREEPORT
If Freeport continues to surge ahead in thefuture as she has in the
past few months, we predict that a new motto will have to be adopted
for the Village -- something like &quot;Freeport, the Village of Firsts&quot;.
FIRST K-9 CORPS ON L.I. ...By October 15 our first police dog,
Mike, will be at work with the Freeport Police Dept. and he will be
joined in a few week by Casper. These two magnificently -trained
German Sheperds and their handlers will make up Long Island&#x27;s first
K-9 Corps, under the direction of Captain Edward S. Dixon. Mike
and Patrolman Harry B. Nicolino were trained at Canine College in
West Redding, Conn., while Casper and Patrolman Gary Steinberg
received their training with the Hartford Police Dept. Other patrol-men
will be trained in Freeport so that each dog will have several
possible handlers and will be able to work with different squads in
special cases. Freeport is receiving national publicity with this pro-ject;
you may have seen Mike and Ptl. Nicolino with Art Linkletter on
the &quot;Tonight&quot; show recently over NBC-tv. There have been feature
lay-outs with pictures in NEWSDAY and the N. Y. JOURNAL AMERI-CAN,
while we expect others in the L.I. PRESS, N. Y. TIMES and
several national magazines.
FIRST CODE OF ETHICS ON L. I. ... When the Village Board re-cently
adopted a Code of Ethics as Local Law #1 - 1962, Freeport be-came
the first municipality on Long Island to make into law a specific
standard of conduct to be followed by all elected and appointed offi-cials.

SNOW TIME NO TIME TO LEAVE CARS IN STREET
If the Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac is accurate, we may be in for a try-ing
Winter of cold weather, ice and snow. It&#x27;s not too early to think
about snow removal regulations.
Every snowstorm is regarded as an emergency situation. There-fore,
one of the first things to remember is that all cars MUST be
removed from streets and Village parking lots. If your car is parked
at the curb or in a municipal parking lot when the snow plows arrive,
it will not only be buried in snow, but it can be tagged and towed away
and you will have to pay to get it back.
Cars parked in snowy streets constitute not only a traffic hazard
but also a fire hazard. They make it almost impossible to maneuver
fire equipment in situations that are difficult at best. Ambulance sand
emergency service vehicles must get through.
Remember the Fire Department, too, when you are cleaning your
sidewalks, and clear the snow away from hydrants and fire alarm
boxes near your property. The house you save may be your own.

in a two-day period, for which he has earned a commendation &quot;for
keen police duty&quot;.
* The Railroad Avenue Committee (JoeVito, chairman; Charles Koe-nig
and Eddie Vasil) for their work leading to the renaming of this once-unsightly
thoroughfare. Freeport Plaza is more in keeping with the
attractive appearance of the street today.

SURVEY FOR FREEPORT MASTER PLAN GETS UNDERWAY
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney has been advised that the Village&#x27;s ap-plication
for urban planning assistance has been approved, and the
development of a Master Plan can get underway immediately. The
cost of the plan, about $44, 000, is divided among the Federal govern-ment,
which pays two-thirds, the State and the Village, which pay one-sixth
each.
The Master Plan will be drawn by Raymond and May Associates,
and should be completed in 8 - 10 months, according to E. Richard
Fortunato, chairman of the Planning Board. Itwill be a comprehen •*
sive study of the Village as it is today --population, zoning, economics,
facilities and so on. Upon its completion, Village. planners will know
whether to proceed with Urban Renewal and what programs to adopt
for the continuing and future well-being of the Village as a whole.
Progress reports will be made at frequent intervals.
&quot;CHRISTMAS JOYS AND CIRCUS JTQYS&#x27;.&#x27;. TO -PARADE&quot;
~&quot; -&quot; TKe&quot;Fbulrth~Annual Christmas Toyland Parade with the theme
&quot;Christmas Joys and Circus Toys&quot; is scheduled to delight young and
old in the Village on Saturday, December 1. The parade, sponsored
by the Chamber of Commerce, will start at 10:15 A.M. at the Stadium.
The line of march is: from Stadium west onMillRoad to MainSt. ;
north on Main to MerrickRoad. ; west onMerrickto Grove St, ; north
onGrove to Sunrise Highway; eas. /.nSunrise to Main; south on Main to
Merrick; east on Merrick to Henry; north on Henry to Newton Blvd.
and into Sunrise, and east onSunrise toBuffaloAve. and the disband-ing
point at Fireman&#x27;s Field.
This is an all -new parade with many colorful balloons and floats,
according to chairman Roy Cacciatore, and it is being directed by
Kent Thomson, who has been acclaimed for his previous Christmas
parades and the recent Historical Parade. In case of bad weather,
the parade will be held on Saturday, December 8.
&quot;SALUTE TO THE TOTH&#x27;A SUCCESS; PHOTO SHOW PLANNED
The Freeport Historical Parade and &quot;Exhibition held in.October in
celebration of the 70th anniversary of the incorporation of the Village
was a great success,. Even the weatherman cooperated and gave us
perfect weather throughout It is estimated that more than 40, 000
people saw the exciting parade on Oct0 20, and probably more than
3,000 persons visited the exhibition at Randall Park that week-end to
see the many fascinating displays and have a snack at the Clam Bar,
Several hundred others participated in the other anniversary ac-tivities?
the Family Square Dance on Saturday night; the ceremony
honoring former Police Justices in Police Court Monday night; the
ceremonies changing the name of Railroad Ave0 toFreeport Plaza on
Oct0 27, and the most enjoyable Old-Fashioned Sunday Night Supper
given by the Chamber of Commerce on the 28th0
. This, great success was due, quite simply, to the unbelievable
amount of time, energy, devotion and whole-hearted &quot;cooperation
given by literally hundreds of people throughout the Village,, &quot;Old-timers&#x27;,
newcomers, young and old and in-betweenall worked togeth-er
in a wonderful display of community spirit to show their pride in
being Freeporters0 It0is simply impossible to start naming names,,
so the Village just says a heartfelt &quot;Thank you&quot; to everyone assoc-iated
with this grand occasion,,
And it&#x27;s not over yet0 Duringthe month of December, photographs
taken during the Festival will be on display on the second floor of the
Municipal Building,, Everyone is cordially invited to visit the show
during regular business hours (Monday through Friday from 8s30 to

ZONING IS EVERYBODY&#x27;S BUSINESS
For the benefit-of tire many newcomers to Freeport and for .those
who live in older sections of town who are interested in maintaining
the value of their property, the NEWS herewith reviews a few facts
about zoning,. We are indebted to the Community Relations Council,
Columbia Heights and Northeast Civic Association for use of mater -
ial from a pamphlet they published a couple of years ago0
Zoning laws are meant to work for everyone, and every citizen
therefore has an obligation to see to it that zoning regulations are
obeyed,. Falling real estate values are caused almost solely by fail-ure
to keep up the property in the neighborhood, so every resident
should keep his own property looking attractive and set standards for
other BO
We have ten zoning districts in the Village,, Only one-family
houses are allowed in Residence &quot;A&quot; and &quot;AA&quot; districts, except in
cases where legal multiple-family dwellings existed prior to April. 1,
I960; these may stay as n on-conforming uses,, No matter how big
the house, not more than two rooms may be rented out and not more
than four persons may occupy the two rented rooms, unless special
permits were granted by the Board of Appeals,, Roomers are not al-lowed
to do any cooking in the house and, if it is a two-family house
or larger, must have a separate bathroom of their own0
Doctors, dentists and other professional people may have offices
in their homes, but for other home occupations, a permit must be ob-tained
from the Village Clerk and certain rules must be observed; al- -
ways check if in doubt,, Garage space or parking space may be pro- $
vided on a lot for not more than three automobiles,, One of these i
may be a truck of 1 1/2-ton capacity or less, but no truck or trailer r&gt;
may be stored outdoors,, Garage space for one automobile only may i
be rented out and this must be a passenger car0
Special rules apply to size, height and location of buildings, and
there must be at least 800 square feet of floor area in every dwelling,.
These conditions are checked upon when the building is erected, but
sometimes there are changes in use or structural changes which may,
not come to the attention of the Supt0 of Buildings unless residents
point it out0 If you see construction or alterationwork going on, you
may phone the Building Dept0 at FR0 8-4000 to see whether a permit
has been obtained;- if the work does not seem to conform to Zoning
regulations, the Village Clerk&#x27;s office can tell you if a variance per-mit
was obtained from the Board of Appeals,,
The Board of Appeals is appointed by the Village Board and has
power to grant a variance when the zoning ordinance is unfair or op=
pressive,. It can grant special permission to do certain things, but
only after the neighbors are notified and a public hearing is held; it
must deter mine that the proposed work done under the permit would
not depreciate the value of other property, alter the essential char-acter
of the neighborhood, or create a nuisance or fire hazard,,

<dc:description>LIGHTING EMERGENCY? HERE&#x27;S PHONE NUMBER TO CALL
Many Freeporters wishing to report power trouble in their homes
or a street light out have been calling the Police Department at night
and on week-ends when the Municipal Building is closed. This places
an added burden on the already-busy men in blue at the switchboard
and sometimes, delays the request for help. There is a 24-hour emer-gency
number at the Municipal Power Plant which you should call in-stead
-- sometimes you may have to let itring a little while, but there
is always someone there to answer and take care of your emergency
at once. The number is FR 8-0146. Try it next time.

ANYONE FOR ICE-SKATING?
There&#x27;s ice-skating -- weather permitting --at North east, North-west
and Randall Parks, all of which are open till 10 P. M. At Ran-dall
there is supervision onSaturdays, Sundays, holidays, and every
day after school until closing time. Come join the fun.
;*****
LET US APPLAUD i&quot;
* Mrs. George M. Maynes, whose outstanding &quot;service for safety in
working for many years with our Bicycle Safety Committee has been
topped by her originating and helping to carry out the new driver re-education
course for experienced motorists, for which she^has re-ceived
the Certificate of Recognition of the New York State Citizens
Council on Traffic Safety. A new driver-re-education course will
start March 7 at FreeportHighSchool and the idea is being copied in
many other communities.
* Public-spirited citizens who help beautify our community by dona-tions
of trees and shrubbery to the Park Commission. Recently these
have included Mr. William H. Schneider whose gift of nine pines,
three birches, four sugar maples and many shrubs may be enjoyed
in Grove East Park. Individuals and organizations interested in this
worthwhile project may contact the Park Commission; cash donations
are also much appreciated and can be used toward specific purchases
if desired.
* The Community Ambassador Program of the Freeport Community
Council, which has sent three fine young Freeporters to live for a
Summer in a family overseas in the very best kind of exchange of
international understanding. Harlee Gritmon went to Holland, Step-hen
Meringoff to France and Lauren Young, who is still a Freeport
High School student and is available to give her interesting slide lec-ture
to all interested organizations, spent last Summer in Austria.
This year the council hopes to raise enough money to send two Free-port
Community Ambassadors, abroad under the aegis of the Experi-ment
in International Living. Your help will be appreciated.

A SUGGESTION FOR A NEW YEAR&#x27;S RESOLUTION
Happy New Year to everyone. And, although most Freeporters
have probably already made as many New Year&#x27;s resolutions as they
plan -- and perhaps have already broken some of them -- VILLAGE
NEWS has a suggestion for a resolution to consider.
Why not resolve to take an active part in your Village&#x27;s affairs
during the coming year?
Only recently we&#x27;ve been celebrating the 70th anniversary of the
incorporation of the Village of Freeport. What does incorporation
really mean, except that it provides us with self-government? We
have our own locally-elected officials and elected and appointed bodies
to carry out the myriad executive and administrative duties of the
municipality. We personally elect local people, acquainted with local
conditions, and we can go to the Municipal Building at any time —or
meet them on the street, or reach them by telephone -- and have in-valuable
personal contact and cooperation in &quot;running things&quot;. In a
very real sense, we eliminate the &quot;middle-man&quot;.
Yet, as Mayor Sweeney once remarked, &quot;I see the same few peo-ple
everywhere I go&quot;. In a Village which is expected to reach 40, 000
population, only a relative handful of residents seems to take a really
active part or a constructive interest in their Village. We have Open
Meetings of the;Village Board every first and third Monday night at
9 P. M. in the Conference Room of the Municipal Building, but very
often only a dozen people attend. Public hearings, which are adver-tised
and publicized widely, bring out a few more, but often only those
with a particular axe to grind. Many who attend Board meetings come
only to complain and have no constructive ideas to offer.
Let&#x27;s make 1963 the year when everyone stops just residing in
Freeport and starts really living here. To paraphrase an old idea,
ask not constantly what Freeport can do for you, but what you can do
for Freeport. We already have a fine community -- let&#x27;s pitch in and
make it a truly great one.
*****
CHRISTMAS IN FREEPORT A REAL COMMUNITY ENDEAVOR
It seemed to many Freeporters that the recent Christmas season
was an especially &quot;Chirstmassy&quot; one in the Village, and we have
many people and groups responsible for this happy situation.
The official Village &quot;family&quot; helped, with the Village Board&#x27;s
originating and- passing an amendment to an old ordinance which had
prohibited music by loud-speaker for many years. Now &quot;religious
and seasonal&quot; music may be played in the business areas over loud-speakers
from Dec. 16 to Jan. 1. and many establishments contribu-ted
tastefully-chosen &quot;music in the air&quot; this year. Another gift of the
Board was free parking at 924 parking meters, which were covered
with bags printed &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. Many Village departments
take part in assisting special endeavors throughout Freeport, includ-ing
Parks, Recreation. Police, Highway, Parking Meters, Lighting
(which also is co-host at one of the best parties in the Village) and
the Beautification Committee.
The Chamber of Commerce and many business men are credited
with gay decorations and lights in the shopping areas as well as the
big Toyland Parade and the large Christmas Tree which shone a wel-come
to all at Cannon Square. The Holy Name Society put up the
lovely Nativity Scene located in front of the Meadow Brook Bank Bldg.
Another interesting Nativity Scene, using live animals, was at the
L. I* Human and Dog Protective Association Shelter. Even the spec-ial
events, parties, church celebrations and home decorations seem-ed
more note-worthy than usual.
Mr. &amp; Mrs. Stephen Mucaria donated the beautiful big Christmas
tree which was so admired in the lobby of Village Hall. Many thanks
to everyone concerned, including those we might have missed men-tioning.

TEEN-AGE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE HAS WORKERS, NEEDS JOBS
Need a baby-sitter, a snow-shoveler, somebody to run errands,
make deliveries, or just be generally useful around your house or
business for a few hours or days? Maybe^you are not aware that the
Teen-Age Employment Service, sponsored by the Recreation Depart-ment
and the Chamber of Commerce, is in business all year round,
not just in the Summer. At present there are dozens of eager young
beavers looking for after-school and week-end jobs. The desk is
open Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 3:30 to 4:30 for young-sters
to register, but if you have a job available, you may call FR 8-
4000 any time during Municipal Building off ice hours to list your needs.
There is no charge to either employer or teen-ager for this service.
*****
SOME DO&#x27;S AND DON&#x27;T&#x27;S FOR WINTERTIME
The following list of hints for motorists and property owners is
presented to assist everyone in facing Winter with less discomfort
and inconvenience. If everyone cooperates, the Village can do its
job faster and it won&#x27;t cost so much, either in dollars or in annoy -
ance.
*Leave your car at home whenever possible when it&#x27;s snowing
or snow is expected.
*Equip your car with snow tires or chains, a shovel, and a box
of cinders or sand.
*Remove your car from streets and parking lots as soon as pos-sible
when snow starts, and don&#x27;t park your car on the street
during a snow storm -- if it has to be towed away, it will cost
you money to get it back. .
*After a street has been plowed, be careful to park properly so
as not to delay or obstruct traffic.
*Never park on the street overnight during snowtime.
*Don&#x27;t abandon your vehicle soas to obstruct traffic or snow plow*
during storms; if an emergency situation arises, call for help
notify Police, and stay with your car until it canbe removed to
a safe spot.
*Remove snow and ice promptly from your sidewalks, but don&#x27;t
push or shovel snow and ice from any private property onto the
street.
*Don&#x27;t place garbage or refuse at the curb overnight during snow

BE A FRIENDLY FREEPORTER IN PARKING FIELDS
We don&#x27;t know how often it happens, but Mayor Sweeney recently
received a letter from a Freeport lady who had the misfortune to hav
he» car banged up rather severely while it was parked in the Munic
ipal Plaza parking field near the railroad station by someone who die
riot bother&#x27;tb leave his name, although, under State compulsory in-surance
laws the damage would have been largely if not completely
covered. It cost the lady almost $200 and, what&#x27;s worse, has made
her wonder if Freeport is really the &quot;Friendly Village&quot; we&#x27;ve alwayi
been so proud to claim.
The parking fields are provided by the Village as a convenience
and service to everyone, and it is a shame that some of our resident!
abuse their privileges. The Village could notpossibly hire attendant;
for all these fields, nor assume the liability for any damages sufferc
there -- so it&#x27;s up to every Freeporter to observe courtesies, goo&lt;
manners and friendly spirits. You mayneed the samefavor someda-j
By the way, don&#x27;t forget to get your new 1963 parking permit at Vil
lage Hall if you wish to use the permit parking spaces --a real bar
gain at $1.

<dc:description>LIGHTING EMERGENCY? HERE&#x27;S PHONE NUMBER TO CALL
Many Freeporters wishing to report power trouble in their homes
or a street light out have been calling the Police Department at night
and on week-ends when the Municipal Building is closed. This places
an added burden on the already-busy men in blue at the switchboard
and sometimes delays the request for help. There is a 24-hour emer-gency
number at the Municipal Power Plant which you should call in-stead
-- sometimes you may have to let itring a little while, but there
is always someone there to answer and take care of your emergency
at once. The number is FR 8-0146. Try it next time.
SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING, CONT&#x27;D.
Federal regulations also prescribe certain priorities for those dis-placed
by a renewal project, veterans of any wars, and those suffer-ing
present shelter hardships. Watch for further announcements, in-cluding
the setting up of an interview office conveniently located in
the Main St. area.

of the Freeport Housing Authority. Copies may be obtained at
the Housing Authority office, 30 Albany Avenue, or at the Municipal
Building, 46 N. Ocean Ave. The 50-unit project should be completed
in early Spring.
Mr. Mack pointed out that there are certain requirements which
applicants must be prepared to meet; you must have been a resident
of Freeport for at least two years, and the applicant or spouse must
be at Ieast62years of age. .There will alsobe maximun income limits,
which will be explained during personal interviews to be scheduled
after applications are received. (see Page 4)
FREEPORT BENEFITS FROM ELECTRIC DEPT. MODERNIZATION
Winds blew hard and long on the last two days of 1962, but not a
single break in primary electricity lines in Freeport were caused by
falling trees or branches. Only 50 emergency calls for repairs
arrived, all of them due to individual service-line trouble and all fixed
in an average time of 20 minutes. It was a fitting climax to a year of
unprecedented up-beat activity and modernization by the Municipal
Power Plant under the Board of Water and Light Commissioners
headed by A. William Hindenlang.
These highlights of the year-end progress report are of interest
to every Freeporter:
* The Village tree-trimming program during 1962 resulted in the
above-mentioned happy situation, wher.e no primary .lines -were
left in a position to be damaged or broken by the wind,.
* Increased voltage, from 2400 to 4160 volts, gives consumers bet-ter
performance for all electrical appliances and also saves the
Village money by reducing &quot;line loss&quot;. The area north of Seaman
Avenue has been converted and the change-over continues else-where.
* The site for a substation has been acquired at Front St. and South
Ocean Ave. When completed and linked to the Power Plant, ever-expanding
South Freeport areas will have even better service.
* Two new bucket trucks were put into service and permit linemen
to work more safely and quickly.
* Some 365 mercury lights, most of them replacing older-style
lamps, were installed in &#x27;62. It is expected that the entire Vil-lage
will be converted by the end of this year. They provide far
more illumination per watt: 400-watt mercury lamps produce
20, 000 lumens apiece compared with the old-type 10, 000.
* For the first time, oil purchases were advertised forbids, and a
... .-tes.t.prjograjn_shpw_ed it.was pos.sible^to usele.ss.expensiye. fue1 i^
the Nordberg engine at the Plant. T^u^pr the year, 1,139, &quot;&gt;&quot;&#x27;•
Ions of black #4 blended oil were bought at a price of more ci.an
20% lower per gallon that the costlier special oil formerly pur-chased
without competitive bids.
* The Board is using its first budget, introduced especially for the
Electric Dept. An operational one for vhe fiscal year ending Feb.
28, it is the basis for closer estimates of proposed expenditures
on the budget just adopted. No financial aid is required from the
Village treasury or from taxpayers.
* A contract was signed in Dec. for a Nordberg engine generating
unit which will allow more efficient production of power.. Its
5,150 kw output (about 2, 000 kw greater than that of any engine
presently in use here) will eliminate operation of the oldest and
least efficient engines except for peaking-service.
(more)
* Extra tasks came into being with the North Main St. widening and
in follow -up of the LIRR grade elimination, with new traffic lights,
ducts and manholes and new wiring called for. There were also
137 tree removals throughout the Village, each with prior approval
by the Village Beautification Committee.
*****
RECENT CHANGES IN VILLAGE PERSONNEL.
Kent Thomson, Supt. of Recreation for the past 8 years, has re-signed
to become Recreation Director for the Town of Hempstead; no
replacement yet. John Marra, a former Fire Chief and long-time
Village employee, is now Supt. of Sanitation and Garage, 1171131 Fred
Frankel as Asst. Supt. Joseph Manz succeeds Marra as Storekeeper
in the Line Dept. Storeroom. - These changes were brought about
with the resignation of Alfred Fortunate, former Supt. of Sanitation
and Garage, who has returned to private business. Elihu Hendon,
local attorney, has been •working for several months as Assistant to
Village Counsel, John O. Tessier.
On Boards and Commissions: Donald S. Katz to the Planning
Board to serve the un expired term of Bernard Abbene, and John Don-ovan
to the Zoning Board of Appeals to serve the rest of Randolph C.
Eareckson&#x27;s term. Samuel L. Iselin has resigned from the Park Com-mission.
Knowlton K. Boyce is now a member of the Parking Field
and Meter Committee.
HOW TO MAKE WATER FLOW WHEN THE TEMPERATURE&#x27;S LOW
Almost all the emergencies handled by plumbers and the Munic-ipal
Water Dept. during the recent frigid -weather could have been
avoided if residents followed a few simple hints .according to William
E. Crevoiserat, S«pt of the Water Dept. Here&#x27;s how:
*Leave faucets open enough to allow a fast drip.
&quot;~L-.eck all -windows and louvers to be sure they are as wind -proof
as possible.
*Make sure that heat is turned on upstairs and anywhere that pipes
might freeze.
*If you go away in winter, have someone check frequently on your
heating system to be sure it is operating correctly at all times.
*****
FREEPORTERS WILL PAY SAME TAXES UNDER NEW BUDGET
The new budget for the fiscal year March 1, 1963 - February 29,
1 964, which was adopted after a public hearing on January 7, means
no increase in Village taxes this year for Freeport residents. They
will still pay $2.49 per $100 of assessed valuation, even though the
total budget is at a record high of $2,679,932.41. All of the increaset
cost of running the Village will be made up through an increase of
over $3, 000, 000 in assessed valuation of real estate.

are receiving unsolicited obscene matter through the mails ,
offers the following advice: &quot;If you receive mail which you consider
obscene, you may file a written request with your postmaster that
future mailings from the indicated source be detainedand disposed of
under postal regulations. You may also turn in the obscene mail to
the post office for appropriate treatment. The cooperation of the
public will aid Federal authorities in their efforts to carry out the
law regarding such material and avoid personal irritation and embar-rassment&quot;.
1963 TAX NOTICE
Village of Freeport taxes, First Half, are due March 1st and
can be paid through April 1st without penalty. If not paid by April

their work. We may now plant 5 kinds of trees between curbs and
sidewalks -- Londonplane, sycamore-maple and white oak, as well
as Crabapple Eleya and dogwood. The Village Clerk will give you
full details when you are ready to plant a tree.
*The Freeport Memorial Library for its invaluable year-round ser-vice
to the community. Not only are there books-for every age-group,
but such special and worthwhile programs as the art lending library;
recordings and films on loan; story hours for youngsters; teen-age
panel discussions and meetings; outstanding reference materials on
every subject, and often-changing interesting displays always open to
the public -- just a few reasons we should observe every week-as Nat-ional
Library W eek.
*The Hannah Senesch Hadassah Group for sponsoring Freeport&#x27;s first
major art show, at Congregation B&#x27;nai Israel on April 20-21. Paint-ings,
sculpture and graphics by dozens of leading national, interna-tional
and local artists will be on display and for sale, with all pro-ceeds
going toward the many worthwhile charitable activities of this
voluntary non-profit organization. Art lovers will have a treat, and
right in Freeport.

NO AUTO DEATHS IN 1962; ANNUAL POLICE REPORT
There were no fatal automobile accidents inFreeportduring 1962,
although there was an increase in the number of automobile accidents
and persons injured over the preceding year, according to the annual
report of the Freeport Police Department issued by Chief Peter Elar.
However, five men lost their lives in four?, major fires.
In comparison with 1961 here are the figures for 1962: 220 auto
accidents, up 39; 364 persons injured, up 49. Injured pedestrians
dropped from 40 to 35; injured bicyclists remained the same, 20.
Stolen property reported amounted to almost $10, 000 less, while
there was a good increase in the amount of stolen property recovered,
up more than $11, 000. Estimated fire damage was $332,415, about
$1,000 more than in 1961, and the Fire Department answered 220
general alarms and 165 still alarms, both increased over 1961.
The message should be clear to, everyone: Drive wi£h care, ob-serve
safety rules, and don&#x27;t give &#x27;fire a chance to start. We have
good Police and Fire Departments,i!15ut they can only help in correct-ing
your mistakes. Preventing accidents is up to you. -

BUILDING PERMITS TOTAL. ALMOST THREE MILLION* IN YEAR
Permits for building operations estimated to cost $2,991,438
were issued by the Freeport &#x27;Building Dept. during the fiscal year
ending February 28, according|to Supt. of Buildings William J. Noll.
Although this is a decline over the top-year-of-all-time figure of
$16,056,751 in permits issued during 1961-62, the comparisonisnot
valid when we consider the special circumstances leading to the re-cord
figure -- the rush of developers to file for building permits for
high-rise apartment houses before the building code was amended to v
limit future apartment house construction to two-and-a-half stories.
Compared with the more normal year of 19oO-6l, when $5,996,866
in permits was issued, it can be seen that Freeport continues to en-joy
a healthy construction record.

SANITATION DEP.T. GOES ON FIVE-DAY WEEK, NEW SCHEDULES
The Sanitation Dept. and Municipal Garage, last two departments
in the Village to work a six-day week, converted to a five-day 40-hour
work schedule on Apr jl 1 with a change-over in collection schedules
throughout the Vi.llag.e. The change was made possible at noadditional
tax cost by the reorganization of the department on a more efficient
basis and the operation of the new collection trucks, according to
Edward A. Voelker, Chairman of the Municipal Board of Sewer and
Sanitation Commissioners.
There are now two major collection areas in the Village. Area 1
includes both sides of Merrick Road and all streets and avenues to
the north. Pick-up days are Mondays and Thursdays for house-hold
garbage.
Everything south of Merrick Road is in Area 11, with household
garbage collections on Tuesdays and Fridays. All these collections
are from rear or side doors.
On Wednesdays, there is a rubbish collection from curbside
throughout the Village. At this time, yard rubbish, grass clippings
and general clean-up waste are picked up, as well as large items
such as refrigerators, stoves and furniture. However, residents are
requested to call FR 8-4005 in advance when such large items are to
be included in the Wednesday collection, and nothing is to be placed
at the curb before 6 P. M. on Tuesdays.
Other rules and regulations are the same as those mailed to
every resident in November. Newspapers, magazines, cardboard,
etc., should be placed in the garbage can with household garbage,
except when large quantities of such refuse exist. Then they should
be bundled and placed beside the garbage can -- not at curbside.

<dc:description>VILLAGE &#x27;SPARES THAT TREE&#x27;.WHEN POSSIBLE ..:
Only about 30 trees are being removed on South Ocean Avenue,
in the more-than-a-; mile area from Sunrise Highway to Front St. ,
because of the need for a higher voltage line to provide better elec-tricity
service in South Freeport.
When possible, the Electric Department has pruned trees in-stead
of taking them down. Often , however, this leaves ugly form-ations
which detract from the beauty of a neighborhood. Some larger
trees also have become diseased and rotted to such an extent that
they create a condition dangerous to public safety. The new power
line will connect Freeport&#x27;s municipal power line with Substation
&quot;D&quot; at Front Street.
FIRE DEPARTMENT FORMS PUBLIC RELATIONS GROUP
Chief Patrick Cotignola of the Fire Department has announced
a new Public Relations Committee. Its aims will include making&quot;
available to social and civic organizations speakers on &quot;Fire Pre-vention,&quot;
&quot;Fire Department Organization,&quot; Fire-Fighting Tech -
niques&quot; and many other interesting subjects.
This committee is headed by former Fire Chief Frank Musso
and James McBride, co-chairman, assisted by Irving Gray and
Arthur Lewis, ex-Captains.
Arrangements for the programs may be made by writing to
James MeBride, 5 West Fourth Street, orFrank Musso, 22South

schedule during the week of Memorial .Day. ...... , /&#x27; -.- •;-•./.
Collectors will omit entirely their usual once-a-week • j t r a s h . ;
pick-up on Wednesday, May 29. •&#x27; • - ; . - . - :

SHORTCUTS TO ELECTRICAL SAFETY
Eight ways to make your home a safer place are suggested by
the Freeport Electrical Department:
(1) DON&#x27;T OVERFUSE. Use only 15 -ampere fuses on branch
circuits. Restrict 20-ampere fuses to kitchen receptacle circuits
-- but use 15-ampere ones there also if the kitchen receptacle cir-cuits
were wired before 1950.
(2) Use no plug fuses which. are larger than 20 amperes in ANY
fuse-holders except. in the service switch.
(3) If with proper size fuses you find that they &quot;blow&quot; frequently,
this is a sign of OVERLOADING. Havewiring checked by a competent
electrical contractor or licensed electrician.
(4) Avoid connecting more than two items to a duplex receptacle.
Don&#x27;t plug in multiple-type connectors^ (&quot;octopus wiring&quot;) at conven-ience
outlets. It&#x27;s much safer to get additional outlets, installed
properly.
(5) FRAYED CORDS, those under carpets, or other cords that
undergo wear from being walked on or from the weight of furniture
are FIRE HAZARDS. Get rid of them. Add new receptacles.
(6) IF LIGHTS FLICKER when appliances start up, it&#x27;s a sign
that your service is inadequate to maintain proper voltage and pre-vent
overheating of motors, and wires in walls. Don&#x27;t starve your
motors if you want them to give full service.
(7) Permit only qualified master electricians, who have a VIL-LAGE
OF FREEPORT LICENSE, to do work on your electrical sys-tem.
Installation should be done in accordance with the National
Electrical or local Electrical Codes.
(8) IF YOU ARE SHORT ON &quot;HOUSEPOWER, &quot; call in a licensed
electrical contractor to do the job properly and supply the Magic
Link to Better Living Electrically through adequate house wiring and
service capacity.

&quot;The Boating and Fishing Capital of the East&quot;
JULY, 1963
LOW JD RATE REDUCED STILL FURTHER
: Youthful troublemakers in Freeport, who last year numbered
only half as many percentagewise as those in the rest of Long Island,
are being reduced considerably by active police work combined with
an educational program. .
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney told the Village Board recently that - ..
only one and one-half per cent of Freeport1 s juvenile population are •&lt;
deliquent children -- a rate less than half as high as that reported
for the areas elsewhere in Nassau and Suffolk.Counties.
During 1962 there were 53 arrests of juveniles in Freeport, ac-cording
to police. At least half-a-dozen ringleaders in these cases
have been committed, after conviction, through constant patrol work
by the entire Police Department, which has kept watch on known
groups.

BOARD URGES COW MEADOW PARK OR PRESERVE
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney has been authorized to send the follow-ing
telegram to County Executive Eugene Nickerson and the Nassau

&quot;The Freeport Village Board at its meeting June 17, 1963 author-ized
me to ask the County of Nassau to consider acquisition of Cow
Meadow for conservation and/or park purposes of such nature that
would not impose a traffic strain on the single access street; With
a court decision on the.requested re-zoning of this area to. residen-tial
use imminent, this last remaining tract of open land of such size
could be lost to the public forever.- Earnestly request careful con-sideration
of such public use by County regardless of Court decision-on
re-zoning. : .

half -hour or half-hours. The fe&#x27;e covering each period is 50 cents
for either singles or doubles. -
When a person phones the Recreation Department for a.court res-ervation
he will tell the number on his ticket. This will be written on
a schedule for the week-end, guaranteeing a court, and will be refer-red
to by the attendant who takes the stub at game time.
• Only ticket-holders will have an opportunity to play during week-ends,
priority going to those who have registered for courts. If there
remain any open courts, other ticket -holders may use them by sur-rendering
a ticket for each half-hour of ..play.
Like other. Recreation Department activities, participation is lim-ited
to Freeport residents.

whom apparently were alerted to the .situation by more than 30 talks
made before organizations recently by Detectives Robert Gordonand

&quot;With the aid of parents,&quot; said Police Chief Peter Elar, &quot;we are
steadily improving conditions which are already better than in neigh-boring

GROVE-EAST PARK A &#x27;HOMEMADE&#x27; &#x27;PROJECT
. .
Except for shrubs donated by civic associations, citizens andGirl
Scouts, and its fence, the new sit-in park on South Grove Street at
East Avenue was created by village employees using materials al-ready
on hand. Park Department worker s landscaped thearea, High-way
Department men built the walks, Electric Department linemen in-stalled
lights. Latest addition is a number of ten -foot benches made
by the Building Maintenance unit of the Highway Department. The
Park Commission plans to add more shrubs and a drinking fountain in
the near future. Residents have found this centrally located haven of
rest a real convenience. Like other parks it is light?-4. all night - an
innovation which, along with police action, has eliminated vandalism.
THE VILLAGE SANITATION DEPARTMENT
The Sanitation Department is divided into four separate units --
collection, incinerator, land-fill and garage. The department is un-der
the jurisdiction of the Sewer and Sanitation Commission. Supt.
John S0 Marra is in charge of the Department, with the various units
directly responsible to either the Assistant Superintendent or a Fore-man.
In the COLLECTION UNIT, Mr. Marra said, &quot;A Foreman and 42
men collect all garbage and trash in a five-day, 40-hourweek. Six
routes north of Merrick Rd. have garbage service Monday and Thurs-day,
while six routes south of Merrick have their garbage picked up
Tuesday and Friday. All trash within the Village is collected at the
curb Wednesday except during holiday weeks when we eliminate this
trash collection. This is necessary to make-sure that all homes have
twice-a-week pickup of garbage.
&quot;We collect over 300 tons of garbage and 200 tons of trash week-ly.
At present each route picks up at more than 700 homes on rear
door garbage collection and 1,400 homes on curb trash collection.
&quot;The business area, waterfront, restaurants, apartment houses
and boatyards are served by the recently installed Dempster system.
This is done with two trucks and four men who at present are empty-ing
281 containers. More and more business places are requesting
containers, but unfortunately they will have to wait until next year for
the new budget when we hope to purchase more of them.
&quot;One man washes and cleans all the trucks daily from 1 to 9 P. M. ,
thereby letting the drivers and helpers spend all their time on their
routes. This work is directly supervised by the Foreman who not
only makes sure that all personnel are assigned to jobs, but also han-dles
any complaints conning to the attention of the department. &quot;
The INCINERATOR UNIT&#x27;S 13 men are directly responsible to the
Assistant Superintendent. The present incinerator was built in 1927
when- Freeport had only 18, 000 inhabitants. Some -repairs-and slight
alterations have been made, but this plant is outdated. A proposed
modern incinerator will have a capacity of six tons per hour in good
weather compared to the old one&#x27;s two and one-half tons per hour.
&quot;Storage for over three days&#x27;^garbage collection will be provided .
in the new plant, &quot; said Mr. Marra.
&quot;The old incinerator worked a five-day week, three shifts per day.
At times it was necessary for some men to work on Saturday to burn
all the garbage collected. Because of the plant&#x27;s low burning capac-ity
and the amount of garbage, the incinerator worked to capacity and
had no safe margin for breakdowns. When the new one is built it will
greatly increase the Sanitation Department&#x27;s efficiency.&quot;
The LAND FILL AREA is rapidly nearing its capacity -- a fact
which forced the closing of this area recently to all contractors and
out-of-town people. There is no charge to residents if trash is brought
in a private auto or station wagon, but a fee of $6 per ton is charged
(Continued on Page 3)
FIREMEN&#x27;S DRILL AND PARADE SEPTEMBER 7-8
Thousands of visitors from all over Nassau County will beattract-ed
to our Village on Saturday and Sunday, September 7-8, for a County
Battalion Championship Drill and Parade sponsored for the fourth
year by Freeport&#x27;s firemen. About 30 departments are expected to
participate. The public is cordially invited, free of admission charge.
Activities will get under way at a block party Saturday at 1 P. M. ,
with games and refreshments, in the municipal parking lot opposite
the Hook &amp; Ladder Co. firehouse on Church St. near Merrick Road.
The parade will start at 6:30 P.M. from, Brookside Avenue, proceed-ing
east to Church Street. This will befollowed by continuation of the
block party, presentation of trophies and dancing and games.
On Sunday, September 8, the Championship Drill will begin at
1 P.. M... on. Firemen&#x27;s Field ,- -Sunrise Highway and Buffalo&#x27;Avenue.
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney has proclaimed the week beginning Sep-tember
2 as &quot;Firemen&#x27;s Week.&quot;
FOOTBALL
Freeport Kiwanis - Recreation Department Midget Football will be
conducted for all local youngsters between the ages of 10 and!4 years,
and between the SOpound and 110 pound weight classification.
Adult touch football is being organized now. For further inform-ation
concerning the Fall recreation program please call the recrea-tion
office, FReeport 8-4000.
*****
SANITATION DEPARTMENT (Continued from Page 2)
for all trash brought in trucks or trailers. At present this unit is
handled by one man who operates the bulldozer and buries trash on one
day per week.
&quot;A big problem for the collection foreman, who supervises the land-fill
division, is children setting fire to the trash,&quot; said Mr. Marra.
&quot;The, department -has been falsely accused by residents and non-resi-dents
of intentionally starting fires in the land- fill area. Such blazes
not only are costly but also keep sanitation men from doing their reg-ularly
assigned jobs. We do not like to call the Fire Department fre-quently,
and tie up their equipment,fp;r many hours, when ..the trucks
should be free to answer real emergencies.&quot;
The GARAGE UNIT comprises a foreman and seven men, directly
supervised by the Assistant Superintendent. Orginally the garagewas
intended to make only minor repairs on the few vehicles then owned by
the village. Today it does all repair work and servicing needed on the
120 vehicles except for an occasional job done by an outside garage.
&quot;An accurate service record is maintained to make sure that all
vehicles are properly serviced when required,&quot; Mr. Marra pointed
out. &quot;Each has its own workfolder listingr epairs and servicing, thus
providing a complete history on all vehicles. Every vehicle owned by
the village is supplied with gasoline at the garage.&quot;</dc:description>

*****
AMENDMENT 4 ON HOME RULE UP TO VOTERS
One of the seven State Constitution amendments up
for approval at the polls Nov. 5 will be a &quot;Bill of
Rights&quot; for local governments. Amendment No. 4
would broaden the powers of citizens in a village,
town, city or county to govern themselves through
their elected representatives.
The change would set up a &quot;Statute of Local Governments&quot; grant-ing
home rule rights. Once included in this statute, a power could be
withdrawn or curtailed only by a law enacted twice by the Legislature
with the Governor&#x27;s approval --once in one calendar year and again
during the next calendar year.&#x27; This amendment would assure local
governments that their powers could not be changed without advance
notice.
If voters approve Amendment 4 the Legislature would still have
authority to enact special laws relating to the property, affairs or
government of a municipality, but could do so only on the basis of a
local home rule request or message of necessity from the Governor,
The municipalities would have power to adopt a local law, pro-vided
it is consistent with general State laws on the subject and pro -
vided the Legislature does not restrict the power of the village, town,
city or county to adopt such a law.

JOHN S. MARRA, SUPT. OF SANITATION
THE VILLAGE CLERK
The Village Clerk wears two hats. He must be &quot;ambassador&quot; of
the local government in its dealings with the public while at the same
time hehas an equally important duty — as chief administrative officer
--to keep the wheels of government turning smoothly.
&quot;When the Mayor and Trustees make decisions my office must get
the necessary information not only to those officials and employees
directly concerned, but also to the general public.&quot; said Village Clerk
John J, MacDonald.
So many different functions fall under his supervision that the
Clerk is assisted in his day-to-day work by a staff made up of deputies,
typists, stenographers, clerks and record keepers.
The First Deputy processes all applications for variances to be
heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals and is the board&#x27;s secretary,,
besides handling a variety of administrative and communications dut-ies
assigned to him.
Licenses are issued under supervision of the Second Deputy Clerk
to plumbers, electricians, sidewalk contractors, employment agencies,
peddlers, etc., as well as for ownership of dogs and fresh-water fish-ing,
to name just a few of the many.
&quot;Inseeking information or making complaints people often don&#x27;t
know where to go, so they come to us, &quot; Mr. MacDonald commented.
&quot;Whenever police learn about damage or failure of village facil -
ities like street or traffic lights, signs, hydrants or roads, they tell
us so that we can send complaint sheets to the proper authorities.
We also enter such items in a ledger where they remain until cancel-led
by a completion notice from one of the department heads.
&quot;This office processes and files important documents. It is cus-todian
of all village records. Among our other chief duties is to keep
minute books of meetings held by the citizen boards and commissions.
&quot;Vital statistics, another important function, are handled by the
Second Deputy Clerk, who is also the Registrar of Vital Statistics.
With the co-operation of doctors we record Freeport births and deaths
and issue burial permits.
&quot;We keep for ready reference all insurance policies held by the
village such as those covering fire, general liability, boilers and ma-chinery,
workmen&#x27;s compensation and auto liability and theft. Inter-views
and correspondence are handled on matters pertaining to the
State Employees&#x27; Retirement System.
&quot;Personnel records of village employees are maintained -- a job
• t$:£££?
that includes negotiations on titles and classifications with the County
•Civile-Service headquarters&#x27;after titles are approved&#x27;bythe;;Mayor and^
Village Board. • „«
&quot;Before anyone can open a road for any purpose, install curbs or
sidewalks, or do various other things, he must get a permit from us.&quot;
The Village Clerk or his First Deputy processes all forms con -
cerning claims against the village, damage to its vehicles, fire dam-age
to municipal property and workmen&#x27;s compensation claims. When
required, they attend preliminary hearings or court trials.
Registration for local elections and establishment of polling places
are also supervised by the Clerk.
Mr. MacDonald joined the Village Clerk&#x27;s office in 1956, became
First Deputy in 1958, and has headed the department since 1961.

<dc:description>HINTS FOR SAFE WINTER DRIVING
Are you making accident -prevention a part of holiday planning?
Have you tire chains for driving in snowy weather? Efficient wind-shield
wiper blades to prevent smeared vision? Have you neglected
the car safety check you intended to get a long time ago ? Have you
&quot;winterized&quot; your driving habits ? Do you always slow down on slip-pery
streets? If y(ou plan to entertain, have you planned it so that
your guests can drive home alert and sober?
In asking these questions Police Chief Peter Elar promises that
his officers will do all they can to prevent unnecessary holiday acci-dents.
&quot;The winter hazards of sharply lowered visibility and reduced
road-traction&#x27;&quot;-were pointed out~by-Chiefs Elar. &quot;Lowered&quot; visibility&quot;
results from falling snow, frost or snow that has not been carefully
cleared from car windows,&quot; he warned. &quot;The dangers of winter
driving could be pretty well neutralized by guarding our two best de-fenses:
our ability to see and our ability to stop.&quot;

DUMP&#x27;S &#x27;NEW LOOK&#x27; PREVENTS FIRES
To prevent fires at the Village Dump, trash brought in is leveled
off by a bulldozer and covered with old Incinerator residue to stop
exposed-burnable material from catching fire. Joe A If an o. Sanitation
Department foreman in charge of trucks and land fill, has taken addi-tional
steps to eliminate what used to be objectionable smoke.
Limitation of &quot;after hours&quot; dumping has helped. At the entrance
on Albany Avenue old lighting poles were inserted many&#x27;feet deep into
the ground so that two heavy cables could be stretched securely across
the road. In the center a &quot;Stop&quot; sign placed on the cables indicates
that the dump is closed. Other signs two or three feet square also, call
attention to the hours for dumping: 8 A. M. until 4 P. M. Monday
through Saturday, the on-duty hours of a man in charge. :
Mr. Alfano and aides have curbed violations at the foot of Buffalo
Avenue near the Stadium. They not only keep close tabs on violators,
but also have made barriers of lighting poles and dirt, backed up with
trenches as a deterrent to trespassing. .,
THE VILLAGE TREASURER
When Freeport self-government began in 1892 the only officials
elected with the first Village President and Trustees were a Treas-urer
and a Collector. Even in those days--when little money changed
hands anywhere in the community--the Treasurer&#x27;s duties were rated
highly important,,
Today our &quot;chief fiscal officer&quot; is also Collector, Assessor and
Budget Officer,, He has charge of the IBM machine work in addition
to water billing, electricity billing and the cashiers who receive pay-ment
of those billSo
More than six million dollars a year are taken in and paid out by
Leonard D0 B0 Smith, who must keep accounts of all receipts and ex-penditures
in accordance with a uniformaccounting system prescribed
by the State Comptroller, The municipal budget totals three million
dollars, electricity receipts account for about $2,500, 000 and water
gross revenue approximately $500,000,,
&quot;I must see that all departments stay within their budgets,&quot; said
Mr0 Smith, whose own department has set an example.
When he became Treasurer less than nine years ago, Mr0 Smith
had a staff of 430 Today personnel numbers only 26, although Free-port
population has grown by about 10, 0000 This economy was achiev-ed
without firing anyone, but simply by not replacing employees who re-tired,
by using IBM equipment, staff training and other new methods
so that authorities rate Freeport&#x27;s the most efficient village office in
New York State,,
&quot;I am pleased with all the employees,&quot; Treasurer Smith comment-ed.,
&quot;Without them an efficient system would be to no avail,,&quot;
Assisting him are two Deputies? the Chief Accountant and the De-puty-
in- charge-of IBM -machine operations,, Divisional heads super.yise
the cashiers» electricity billing, water billing and meter readers,
Office space required to transact all this business, maintain labor-saving
machines and store the records takes up a large portion of the
Municipal Building&#x27;s first floor,
, Mr0 Smith&#x27;s Assessor duties call for appraising of properties for
assessment values betweenApril 1 and October 1 where changes are
made because of new buildings, additions, demolition or fire Ioss0
Except for the above, NassauCounty assessed values are accepted by
the Village,,
As Budget Officer Mr0 Smith puts into proper/form the annual bud-get
which is drawn up in consultationwithhimby the Mayor and True---

issue tax certificates, act as auctioneer on foreclosures of real prop-erty
involved with tax sales, and make reports to the State, County,
Federal government and Public Service Commission, plus special re-ports,,

INCINERATOR&#x27;S NEW PIT DUG
With all necessary demolition work done, construction is proceed-ing
daily on r ehaMlitation and enlar gement of the village incinerator
on Albany Avenue, in an effort to achieve the mid-1964 completion
date, A new pit has been dug. The modern incinerator will measure
50 feet longer than the old one, built in 1927when Freeport had only
about 18, 000 inhabitants,. The plant will have a capacity of six tons
per hour in good weather compared to its predecessor&#x27;s two and one-half
tons per hour. Storage for over three days&#x27; garbage collection
willbe prbvixl&#x27;edo A modern scale house in front of the incinerator: will,
keep records of the amount of garbage collected daily and the trash
picked up weekly.
NO TRASH PICKUPS DECEMBER 25 AND JANUARY 1
On Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day the regular Wednesday pick-ups
of trash will-be omitted.
Sanitation men will collect garbage on the normal days during
those two weeks. Any cardboard boxes or gift wrappings placed at
the curb for a usual garbage collection day will be picked up0
We ask your co-operation in keeping trash, except the boxes and
gift wrappings mentioned above, off curbs during the weeks of Dec,
22 and 29 so that we&#x27;ll have a clean village this holiday season,.
Trash collections will resume Jan, 80

<dc:description>ANOTHER MILESTONE IN FREEPORT&#x27;S PROGRESS
Substation &quot;D&quot; at South Ocean Avenue and Front Street has been
completed, enabling Freeport&#x27;s municipal electric system to keep
pace with the continued growth of electricity consumption.
Linked to the Power Plant on Sunrise Highway by a 15,000 volt
primary line, this new substation is part of the continuing expansion
and modernization of the system,, It will enable secondary distribu -
tion lines in the areas south of Atlantic Avenue to operate at 4, 160
volts rather than the 2,400 volts formerly used. The higher voltage
will insure better operation of electrical appliances while increasing
system efficiency by reducing &quot;line loss.&quot; No changes are required
in customer connections for the improved operation.
Complete landscaping has been included in the design of the new
substation to .allow it to blend artistically with its neighbor hood0
Shrubs and trees have already been planted and lawns will be install-ed
in the Spring. Electric Department linemen handled the construct-ion
and installation of major elements of the new facility at consider-able
savings to the Village,, They also installed a high voltage feeder
line from the Power Plant along Sunrise Highway and down Ocean
Avenue to the substation,, This included the installation of modern ,
taller poles and special Power Plant equipment,,
DOG LICENSE TIME IS HERE!
It&#x27;s &quot;dog license time&quot; at the cashier&#x27;s counter in the Municipal
Building. Anyone may take out a 1964 license now by paying a fee of
$2.25 for each male or spayed female dog and $5.25 for eachunspay-ed
female dog.
Failure to obtain a tag by Feb. 10 subjects owners to a $10 fine
and costs. After that date the dog is liable to seizure, and if not re-deemed
within five days may be sold or destroyed.

THE SEWER DEPARTMENT
Edwin C0 McKeeman, Superintendent of the Sewer Department,
headed the system when it started operating in 1929o He scored an-other
first by becoming original Superintendent of the department
when itwas separated from Sanitation in 19520 His service as admin-istrator
of Freeport sewer facilities totals more than 27years, inter-rupted
only by appointment in the early &#x27;40s for nine years as Super-intendent
of Sanitation
&quot;The original trunk line was 10 1/2 miles Iong0 &quot; said Mr0 McKee-man,
&quot;planned so well that only 3 1 / 3 additional miles of trunks have
been required to take care of more than 87 miles of sewer pipes laid
through our streets during the Village&#x27;s tremendous growth. The
present pipage is over 101 miles, serving more than 8,000 connections,,
&quot;You&#x27;ve probably noticed the blacktop center strip in Freeport
concrete roads. That space, wisely provided in pre-sewer days, has
accommodated the pipes and manholes built since then. We haveJthr-ee
&#x27;sewer service men&#x27; who visit each manhole at least once a year to
clear out tree roots and other obstructions,, Our. sewer inspector care-fully
checks each new individual connection to the system,, He also
periodically inspects commercial users&#x27; grease-traps-and the main
grease-traps in apartment houses.
&quot;Besides those four men and myself, there are an Assistant Sup-erintendent
and 12 other employees who work in the sewage treatment
plant at the foot of Albany Avenue, The newest job is that of a full-time
chemist who since Jan0 11 of last year has constantly made anal-yses
in our lab on the premises to see if proper amounts of chlorine,
are applied,,
&quot;We have a &#x27;high rate filter plant,, &#x27; Treatment consists of five
stages: (1) Primary settling in tanks, (2) Filtering through eight feet
of stones to create biochemical oxidation, (3) Secondary settling in
tanks, (4) Chlorination to kill the bacteria which up to this point had
been a desirable aid and, (5) Outflow of purified effluent, while the
treated sludge goes to the dump.
&quot;All trunk lines lead to the main pumping station at Sports man&#x27;s
Avenue and Ray Street,, Extension of coverage to the southern area
in 1949 necessitated three smaller &#x27;lift stations. &#x27;
&quot;Originally designed to handle 1 1/2 million gallons daily, the
treatment plant&#x27;s capacity has since been enlarged to 4 million gallons.
One of the biggest modernization projects took place about four years
ago when $250, 000 Federal aid supplemented a $750, 000 expenditure
by the Village0 As its only revenue ordinarily comes from fees for
the privilege of connecting private lines to the system, the Sewer De-partment
needs an annual budget of slightly more than $100, 0000
&quot;Pipes of the system vary in diameter from 8 to 27 inches.&quot;
Last year Supt. McKeeman received the Arthur Sidney Bedell
Award, given by the Water Pollution Federation to one per son annually
for &quot;outstanding personal services&quot; to the Federation&#x27;s New YorkState
association. He is a former president of the 600-member State group.
SENIOR CITIZENS OCCUPY SOUTH MAIN STREET PROJECT
The long awaited moving-in day came Dec. 10 for the first eight
tenants of the new Senior Citizen Project. On that day Super inten -
dent of Buildings William J. Noll issued a certificate of occupancy
for Building No. 5, facing Raynor Street -- and without further ado
the seniors started moving in.
Among the first was Mrs. Ellen Cronin, mother of Sgt. Daniel
Cronin, Freeport Police Department. &quot;It&#x27;s like coming home,&quot; she
said0 &quot;I know this neighborhood so well, from a long way back.&quot;
And that set the happy mood in which the homes were occupied.
Mrs. Laura Sunday was torn betweenhappiness withher new home
and sadness at leaving children and grandchildren where she had been
living. But anticipation of their visits to her made everything bright
again.
Mrs. Louise Ellison told Housing Authority Chairman John Mack
how she had worked at Ellison&#x27;s Seaside Hotel in Point Lookout, long
before roads and causeways ended the isolation of the area. &quot;It was
before your time,&quot; she told the Chairman. But it really wasn&#x27;t,
said he, because he used to spend his schoolday summers camping
near the old hotel, and he told her a few things about the goings-on
around those parts in the good old days. Mrs. Ellison is the mother
of Patrolman Edwin Ellison of the Freeport Police Department.
Mrs. Maude Adshead, who works for Spitzler&#x27;s, is also in that
first building, together with Elizabeth Betz and Madeline Johnson,
old-time local residents. Mrs. Susan Rand el, daughter of fifth Vil-lage
President (Mayor) Julius Detmer, occupying the westernmost
apartment on the Raynor Street side, told of playing in her girlhood
along the waterfront.
Building No. 4 was ready Dec. 17, about 30 families had moved
into the project by Christmas, and plans at this writing called for
occupancy by all the other tenants shortly thereafter.
HERE &#x27;N&#x27; THERE
The Village Board has strengthened Zoning Ordinance enforce-ment
by specifying exactly what the definition &#x27;family&quot; means. Sug-gestions
by the Mayor&#x27;s Committee on Community Affairs were ap-proved
unanimously after a public hearing. The Building Department
can supply additional information... A large crowd of late District
Court Judge Moxey A. Rigby&#x27;s friends attended ceremonies renaming
Federal low-rent housing apartments on Albany Avenue in his honor
... Franklyn Square, the narrow one-block road between South
Main and Bedell Streets, has been made a one-way westbound street
for safer driving to and from the parking field at new Senior Citizen
homes... Christmas decorations at the Memorial Library were han-dled
by a Freeport Garden Club committee. Other committees of the
Garden Club provided holiday decorations in the railroad station (win-ning
first prize from the L. I. R. R. ) and at the Freeport Historical
Museum.</dc:description>

for transient boat berthing, with resultant benefits to Freeport
business.
To demonstrate such public approval, the Mayor has asked organ-izations
to express their attitude. All this information will be convey-ed
to Mr.^Far.r4.ngtpn when_available. Already the Northeast and the
Southwest Civic Associations have gone on record endorsing the mar-ina.
The Nor thwest Civic Association&#x27;s governing body has approved.
The Atlantic South Civic Association has given a &quot;go-ahead&quot; signal,
asking only that they see the final plan before voting. Colony Park and
Harbbr Civic Associations have reserved decision pending further
study. _; • • .
v Raymond and&#x27;Mayj ; planning consultants who are preparing a Mas-ter
Plan for Freepprt, find the East Point site ideal for the marina.
They have commented that Freeport&#x27;s recreational areas of 50 acres
fail far short of the 40.0 Federally recommended for a community of
this size.
; If we are to persuade the Town of Hempstead to use its land and
money for-a public marina in Freepoft, we must show the officials a
genuine, mass sentiment for the improvement. If you are in favor of
an- East Point Marina, write to the Mayor.

&quot;The Boating and Fishing Capital of the East&quot;
February, 1964
THE PROPOSED EAST POINT MARINA
Freeport has a slogan ..... &quot;Boating and Fishing Capital of the
East.&quot; In nearly all ways we live up to that slogan.; Our waterways
are without equal along the East Coast. We are ideally located in
relation to the great population centers. Rail and road access to bur
Village leaves little to be desired. We have shipyards, yacht clubs,
fishing fleets, marine business and industry. .We are right at the
doorway to the Atlantic, Jones Inlet. Truly we have everything. .....
.except one things We have no public marina.
New Plan Attracts Support
Through the-years various ideas for Freeport marinas have been
suggested.. But none attracted widespread support until:the proposal,
of utilizing the East Point area for this purpose was advanced. Since
then public support-and approval for the idea have been growing rap-idly.
Citizens and civic groups have suggested changes and improve-ments,
and slowly the process of public discussion has been forming
a marina plan that holds great promise for Freeport.
The illustration in this iss&#x27;ue of &quot;Village News&quot; is in effect a pro-gress
report on the development of this idea. The drawing incor-porates
the many suggestions advanced to eliminate citizen object-ions,
prevent heavy traffic flow, and make this a community asset.
During recent months Mayor Sweeney who originated the idea,
members of the Waterfront Committee and Park Commission members
have addressed a number of civic associations and other organiza -
tions. Numerous questions and suggestions at these meetings have •
resulted in genuine improvements in the original conception. News-papers
have made suggestions, which have been carefully considered.
The resulting plan, shown here, is the sixth complete revision, with
all swimming pools and the usual park facilities left out.
The plan also includes Little League baseball fields and a prom-

<dc:description>PROTECT YOUR HOME
Burglary is a problem,but something can be done to prevent it.
Whenever you leave your home to spend an evening or a week-end
elsewhere, housebreakers may move in if they&#x27;re certain you have
left. Burglars spend their daylight hours &quot;casing&quot; neighborhoods,
looking for uncut lawns and overstuffed mailboxes. They spend their
spare evenings looking for darkened houses--or lights left on too
long.
HOW TO DISCOURAGE BURGLARS AND PROWLERS
If you&#x27;re leaving home for more than an evening, have you:
(1) Cancelled all daily deliveries? (2)Left a lamp or two connected to
an automatic timer, so that your lights turn on at dusk, turn off again
at bedtime to create a &quot;lived in&quot; look while you&#x27;re away?(3) Discon-tinued
the newspaper (or arranged to have it forwarded? (4)Notified
Police and a neighbor as tcf the- date =&gt;of your, departure and return?
(5)Left shades or blinds in normal position--not completely closed?
(6)Shut and locked all windows and doors, including the garage?
(7)Arranged to have your lawn cut? (8) Arranged with a neighbor or
the postoffice to hold all mail? (9) Used pin-tumbler cylinder locks
(with a dead-lock mechanism) on all exterior doors? (10) Rented a
safety deposit box for storage of all valuables?
You can help your Police Department reduce burglaries in Free-port
by following this guide. And always report suspicious persons,
questionable or dangerous actions to your Police Department by dial-ing
&quot;0&quot; for operator or FR 8-0700,.

THE WATER .DEPARTMENT
(Continued from Page 3)
Mr. Crevoiserat first entered public service on a commission that
zoned Freeport in 1923-24, and served on the Zoning Board of Appeals
before his election as a Village Trustee. Born in Freeport, the Water
-Superintendent-recalls,hills,. valley_s_and streams ojn^local farms be-fore
homes (or streets) came into existence. This knowledge of nat-ural
high and low land has helped in planning or servicing water mains.
&quot;Replacement of old mains has been stepped up,&quot; said Mr. Crevoi-serat.
&quot;It was found that meadow bog electrolysis in South Freeport
areas quickly ate out cast iron pipe. As disintegration occurred, we
installed asbestos cement pipes instead.
&quot;Pressure is provided entirely by the two elevated tanks--one with
a half-million gallons capacity at the Northeast Water Shed and the
other capable of holding a million gallons, on Sunrise Highway. &quot;
The Water Department, which started its work in 1894, was&quot;Daddy&quot;
of our electricity system. Our forefathers saw steam engines pump-ing
water into a standpipe and.decided to hook up an electricity geaer-ator
to one of them--for street lighting. The same plant served a
double purpose until the Northeast Water Shed tank and wells were
developed in 1929.

RECREATION PROGRAM A CO-OPERATIVE PROJECT &#x27;
1964
The Freeport Recreation Department furnishes a majority af all
community recreation programs, under the jurisdiction of the Park
Commission and in close teamwork with the Park Department, at all
Village playgrounds. During the Winter it also maintains recreational
activities in six Freeport schools with the co-operation of the School
Board. The program is a dynamic, ever-changing effort to meet the
needs of all ages.
Leadership is structured around staff members who are employed
durine the Winter as teachers in Freeport&#x27;s school system.
The Department also strives to assist local groups to fulfill their
goals working with youth in community ventures. All outdoor facilities
(ball fields--picnic areas) are scheduled through the recreation offices.
Close co-operation of the Park Department provides the key to suc-cess
in this entire program, as it has the responsibility of developing
and maintaining all areas, as well as to assist with over-all planning.
The Park Department schedules feature events at the Freeport Stad-
4um, assisted by the Recreation Department.
SPRING PROGRAM &#x27;
Supervised playground programs are sponsored by the Recreation
Department at Northeast, Northwest and Randall Parks March 23
through March 29 fr.om 3:30 to 5:30 P. M^ every afternoon after school.
The Easter Vacation Program runs from March 26 to April 3,10
A. M. until noon and IP. M. until 5 P. M. at the above-mentioned
parks with the exception of Saturdays and Sundays.
An Easter Egg Hunt is planned at all three Village playgrounds
Saturday, March 28, from 12:30 to 2:30 P. M.
Requests are being accepted for use of Village ball fields and pic-nic
areas. For further information call FR 8-4000.
STRICTER ORDINANCES ON DOGS
If dogs are caught running at large, their owners face heavier
penalties under an amended Village ordinance. Violations bring a
fine up to $100, while the fee to redeem seized animals has been
raised to $10.
Damage, injuries and annoyances caused by dogs led to public
demand for the new regulations, as well as for a tightening of rules
on &quot;walking the dog&quot;. Owners should restrain their pets from com-mitting
nuisances on public sidewalks, the areas between sidewalks
and curbs, parks, stations, parking fields, floors or halls of apart-ment
houses or other places used in common by the public, The fine
for each offense has been set at $25.
&quot; The ordinance on &quot;Animals Running at Large&quot; prohibits them
from being at large in&#x27; streets, public places or the premises of any-one
other than the owner or keeper, unless the owner or occupant of
such premises grants permission. Leashes used in walking a dog must
not exceed six (6) feet in length, held by a person of adequate age and
discretion.
It is the duty of authorized persons to seize any dog found running
at large. The pound keeper shall, on receiving any such dog, immed-iately
notify the owner or harborer. Any dog so seized may be re -
deemed by the owner upon payment of $10 to the Village Clerk, and in
addition, if such dog is unlicensed, by the payment of the license fee.
All dogs not so redeemed within five (5) days after -such seizure shall
be destroyed.
Any owner or harborer of a dog violating this ordinance, known as
No. 1.1, will be subject to a fine of not more than $100 for each offense
and is declared to be a disorderly person as provided in Article 3 of
the Unified Code of Ordinances.
LET&#x27;S KEEP FREEPORT CLEAN!
Because our Sanitation Department collects more than 300 tons
of garbage and 200 tons of trash weekly, residents&#x27; help is important
to keep Freeport clean. We shall all benefit if we follow these sugges-tions
from Superintendent John S. Marra:
(1) For Wednesday TRASH COLLECTIONS, don&#x27;t put out any trash
at the curb until after 6 P. M. TUESDAY NIGHTS, but do so before
6 A. M. Wednesday. Please wait until SUPPERTIME TUESDAYS-at
the earliest to put out unwanted articles, for neatness&#x27; sake.
(2) When there is a holiday in any week, the usual Wednesday pick-up
of trash will be eliminated. However, each home will have twice -
a-week collections of garbage.
(3) If you wish a copy of the rules and regulations, please call the
Sanitation Department at FR 8-4000.
THE WATER DEPARTMENT
Pumping about 1.1/2 billion gallons in the past year, Freeport&#x27;s
Water Department ha&#x27;s done more than keep up with rapidly growing
demand. It has anticipated increased needs so that restrictions on the
use of water are unnecessary, even in dry spells.
&quot;Consumers here pay water rates one-third lower than other dis-tricts,
in the vicinity,&quot; said Water Department Superintendent Will-iam
E. Crevoiserat. &quot;The rates have gone up only twice in 70 years.
Taxpayers get an additional bonus: Free hydrant service and free
water for municipal buildings, parks and the public library, keeping
taxes lower by about eight cents per $100 assessed valuation than they
otherwise would have been.
&quot;Few homeowners realize that the extremely low fire insurance
rates result largely from dependability.of our water supply. In fact,
fire insurance rates are based 34 per cent on this reliability as well
as the water pressure, and 30 per cent on fire departments. In Free-port
the two departments always maintain close co-operation.&quot;
Mr. Crevoiserat has participated in two big periods of water faci-lity
expansion--during the late 1920s and the past 10 years. He was a
Village Trustee, serving as Chairman of the Village Board&#x27;s Water
Committee, in 1929 when the Northeast Watershed, first elevated tank
and first deep wells were introduced. Twenty-five years later, when
Mr. Crevoiserat became Superintendent, the department increased
its source of supply to seven 500-foot-deep wells, extended or en-larged
many mains throughout South Freeport and added an auxiliary
engine at each of the two huge storage tanks to assure uninterrupted
service in case of electric failure.
No increase in staff has occurred within the past 10 years. The de-partment
chief has 11 employees under his supervision: Seven in op-erating
and maintenance work, three meter readers and one secretary.
Clerical financial duties are handled by employees under direction
of the Village Treasurer.
Meanwhile receipts have almost tripled and the equity of the water
plant has increased by more than half a million dollars. Through a
long-range &quot;pay as you go &quot; policy, earnings are used to pay for im-provements
and thereby keep debt redemption costs down. But unex-pectedly
rapid growth in demand—about 2,000 additional meters in
10 years--has necessitated some bond issues in order to keep ahead of
present needs. The Water Department takes pride in 100 per cent fi-nancial
self-sufficiency, paying off all bonds, interest and maintenance
costs out of revenue.
A five-member Board of Water and Light Commissioners super-vises
Freeport&#x27;s two utilities, with its major decisions subject to
approval by the Village Board. &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;&quot;L

DREAMS OF COW MEADOW PARK SLOWLY COMING TRUE
In May, 1961, when Mayor Sweeney appointed the Cow Meadow
Committee, the problem of Cow Meadow seemed so complicated and
controversial as:to defy .solution. Efforts were being made by the
private owner to .have the area rezoned for apartments, then private

homes, and then to sell it to the Long Island Lighting Company as a
generator site. Hopes of finding a solution agreeable to the citizens
of Freeport were very dim.
The Cow Meadow Committee studied the problem for five intensive
months and then, on October 30, 1961, reported its recommendation
to the Village Board: &quot;That Cow Meadow be removed from private
ownership and used for the benefit of the people.&quot;
There followed months of patient, often frustrating efforts by the
Cow Meadow Committee and Mayor Sweeney to get support from the
Town, County or State for public acquisition of Cow Meadow. At last,
in late 1963, the County of Nassau expressed interest in Cow Meadow
as a nature -center, conserva-tion-
type park. On March 9,
1964 the park proposal was ap-.
proved by the County Board of
Supervisors at a public hear-ing.
Step by step the Cow Mead-dow
Committee&#x27;s dream of a
beautiful park in this marsh-land
area comes closer to real-ity.
Mayor Sweeney, in a brief
statement issued after the re-cent
public hearing, said: &quot;It
all goes to prove that when ded-icated
people of good will get
behind a proposal, they can
literally move mountains.
Despite the calamity howlers,
petty political opposition and
numerous other obstacles, this committee of 12 civic leaders has per-for.
med a s er vie e, of . gr eat and. lasting- value .tOrFree.porrt.-;I ;W;ould like
to repeat at this time for the record, the names of the 12 members
of the original Cow Meadow Committee: John B. Mack, chairman,
Wilfred Allen, Clifton B. Smith, Mrs. Rosamond Javorsky, Jerry
Magit, Daniel Mandel, Ivan Rocafort, Stanley J. Roth, Fred Schwartz,
Hy WalHs, Stanley Taylor and Rod Vandivert. Regardless of the
broad political, racial and religious differences in the committee, it
found complete harmony on the common ground of public service.&quot;

IT&#x27;S CLEAN-UP TIME FOR ATTICS , BASEMENTS, YARDS
OUR VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
With its more than 380 members, the~voiunteer Fire Department
is larger than all other departments of the Village combined. Since
a payroll for so many trained workers would amount to many hun-dreds
of thousand dollars, local taxpayers are fortunate that Free-port
firemen serve without pay. We have reason to be thankful, also,
that nearly all the volunteers stay in active duty year after year giv-ing
us the benefit of their long training and experience.
Freeport enjoys Class A rating by the New York Fire Insurance
Rating Organization, based upon the efficiency, equipment and water
supply of the Fire Department. This &quot;high mark&quot; gives our residents
the lowest possible fire insurance rates.
Chief Patrick Cotignola has placed special emphasis in the past
year on two goals: (1) Preventing fires by having speakers and dem-onstrators
appear before several thousand persons a year, and (2)
Systematic cataloging of buildings and areas which could present
special problems, so that the department can develop a &quot;battle plan&quot;
to use if called there.
A newly created Public Relations Committee has given demon-strations
and/or talks on fire prevention before more than 4, 000
persons since its appointment last Spring by Chief Cotighols. Repre-sentatives
have appeared before all Sixth Grade classes in&quot;the schools
and many organizations. The borrowed apparatus used during these
demonstrations was so effective that the department now owns its own
similar equipment. V;
Local organizations interested in having a fireman present one of
the dramatic safety demonstrations--or in selecting a sound film
from among the 15 available--may arrange it through the committee
which comprises James C. McBride and ex-chief Francis J. Musso,
co-chairmen; Joseph Cleary, James Clarke, Bruce Willets and
Irving Gray.
Fir-emen Well Trained
-.-.-:• &#x27;.&#x27;Each volunteer admitted into membership&#x27;must pass through a
probationary period in which he attends a fire school training course
conducted by a chief instructor and eight others, one from, each of
the companies,&quot; said Chief Cotignola. &quot;He also attends the Nassau
County Firemen&#x27;s School in Bethpage. Besides the thorough training
gained from both courses, every member of the Emergency Com-pany
must earn an Advanced First Aid Card from the Red Cross by
attending classes and passing tests.
&quot;During the past year an average response of 90.2 men turned out
for general alarms, slightly better than in 1962. This improvement
was achieved despite an increase in general alarms from 203 to 249,

years. ;
&quot;Trophies are awarded during National Fire Prevention Week for
the best posters and essays written by students in the Fifth and Sixth
Grades of all Freeport schools. We plan realistic fire drills, using
all our men and equipment in collaboration with school and county
officials.
&quot;The department has its own blood bank for firemen&#x27;s immediate
families. Donations are made twice a year through the Inter-County
Blood Bank. The local firemen also sponsor Softball, bowling and:
Little League teams.
&quot;When invited to interdepartmental drills and parades, Freeport
usually specializes in parades, seldom entering drills. The vamps
have won many titles for marching, most men in line, best-appear-ing
department and best band. Former State marching champions,

York competitions to the extent of from 8 to 12 parades a year. In i;
1963 they won first places at Long Beach, Hicksville, Oceanside and

band, widely known for its ability, plays in all parades with the fire-men
and at many other departmental functions.

STATE BOAT -LAUNCHING RAMPS . -: &#x27;
Freeport has the first large boat-launching ramps constructed
on Long Island by the State of New York. Dedication ceremonies
were set for Saturday, May 9, at 10 A.M. near-the foot of Albany
Ave. on Stadium Park Canal.
Equipped with two steel-reinforced concrete launching ramps,
the site is&#x27;completely landscaped by the planting of hedgerows,
trees and about two acres of lawns. The 700-foot bulkhead has a
five-foot stone walk along it in addition to 10 metal ladders for
boarding and disembarking. The ramps are built over a bed of stone,
with a system of piling which conforms to a 10 per cent slope.
A graveled parking area will accommodate 85 cars and trailers.
Additional blacktopping and sanitary facilities will be provided as
funds become available. The first phase of this boat-launching site
has been completed at a cost of $140, 000, &#x27;under a lease granted to
the Conservation Department for 25 years.
If it rains the dedication will be postponed a day to Sunday after-noon,
&quot;May 10, at 2 o&#x27;clock instead of Saturday morning.

Among those on the platform will be representatives of the
Village Board; William Clinton Story and Henry Morrison Deloney
Posts, American Legion; Henry Theodore Mohr Post, V.F.W,;
Monsignor Mahon Memorial Post, Catholic War Veterans, and the
British War Veterans.
OUR VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
(Continued from Last Month)
A Council made up of the Chief, both Deputy Chiefs and two
Wardens from each company makes recommendations on firemanic
matters to the Mayor and Village Trustees.
The Village Board provides an annual budget for the department.
Firehouses are built with tax money, but individual fire companies
supply their own furnishings for the buildings.
Freeport&#x27;s Emergency and Floodlight Company is rated one of
the best in New York State by persons qualified to judge. With its
combination airport-type coach bus and ambulance, the unit can
handle any type of emergency problem. It becomes a mobile aid
station at fires or disaster areas.
&quot;The Emergency Company keeps an &#x27;invalid file1 showing where
invalids-live, &quot; said newly elected Chief Paul Fa-lcone, &quot;so that spec-ial
effort can be made to get them out of burning buildings. Names
of such physically handicapped persons and their addresses should
be sent to me or to the Emergency Company.&quot;
&quot;A Freeport resident since about 1930 , Chief Falcone joined the
Hook and Ladder Company 28 years ago and became its Captain in .
1953-54. He helped to form the Emergency Squad, rising through its
ranks to the Captaincy in 1950-51. After a long campaign with the
help of others he was instrumental in having the squad converted
into the Emergency and Floodlight Company :in 1959. Mr. Falcone
heads a firm, which he organized about six years ago, to do traffic
stripe work. His company served the New York World&#x27;s Fair. In
earlier years he was associated with the Town of Hempstead High-way
Department and taught industrial procedures.
&quot;When we respond to an alarm a Fire Police Squad handles
traffic flow near the scene of the blaze and helps in other emergen-cies,
&quot; said Chief Falcone. &quot;Alarms are received at Police Head-quarters
either by phone or through fire boxes.
&quot;Since February 15 our members have had a wave-length differ-ent
from that of the Police, to receive individual radio alarms from
a new transmitter at Police Headquarters. Federal Communications
Commission regulations required the change-over to a separate
wave-length.
&quot;Commercial buildings are checked by a committee of fire in-spectors
to see that they obey safety codes.
&quot;Two fund-raising events are run: the Fourth of July fireworks
show and demonstration which for nine years has drawn crowds ex-ceeding
14, 000 persons to the stadium, and a drive for funds each
autumn.
&quot;An increasingly popular activity is the Nassau County Battalion
Championship Parade and Drill in September, with a big parade and
bazaar on Saturday, followed by the drill program at Firemen&#x27;s

BOAT-LAUNCHING RAMPS DEDICATED
County, Town and Village notables turned out in large numbers
May 9 for the dedication of the first State boat-launching ramps on
Long Island, near the foot of Albany Avenue. In addition to local
dignitaries the speakers included Joseph-F. Carlinoy Speaker of the
Assembly; State Senator Edward J. Speno, ancLDr. Harold Wilm,
Conservation Department Commissioner, who called •Freeport&#x27;s
facilities a splendid example of what can-be accomplished-by co-operation
between State and Village officials.
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney, commenting upon the site&#x27;s attrac-tiveness,
thanked the State authorities for assigning to Freeport
^the^fri-r-st-such-impr-ov.ement^m^ of.
having learned from a Conservation Department member several
years ago that it would be possible for the Village to obtain such
ramps for launching small boats. After leasing the site to New
York State for 25 years, and handling its operation during that time,
Freeport will take it over unless the-Mayor and VillageyBbard pre-fer
to let the present arrangerrrerit continue&quot;, he said.
* Three beautiful mercury lights--each with 4, 000 watts capacity--
installed on the parking field were praised by Park Commission
Chairman Mannie Messing in a talk.caUing attention to the fact that
Village-owned property at the foot of Albany Avenue is becoming a
real &quot;garden spot. &quot; A completely landscaped parking area for the
two ramps will soon have for its neighbors a proposed industrial
park and the soon-to-be-levelled-off landfill area.

ILLEGAL ROOMING-HOUSES FACE CRACKDOWN •..:
Both the Building Department and Police Court arse clamping
down on rooming-house operators who flagrantly violate the Village
ordinances.
After penalties had been imposed on two persons convicted of
running lodging houses without licenses, Police Justice Edwin J.
Freedman said that in these cases he found the defendants had know-ingly
and deliberately broken the law. William J. Noll, Building ;
Superintendent, pointed out that each day their violatio&#x27;n~continued,
the defendants were subject to an additional $100 fine.
THE PURCHASING AGENT
It&#x27;s only natural that Purchasing Agent Raymond T. Keirnan feels
at home in the Municipal Building. He lived on ttie same site when
his father owned a home there, years before the present building
came along in 1928.
Mr. Keirnan completed his 10th year in the post April 7. He form-erly
was a Park Commissioner for about six years, during which he
and Branch Rickey installed turnstiles at the Stadium and brought in
new concessionaires, putting the Stadium in the black financially.
Mr. Keirnan headed the Commission in 1952-53. His background
with the Nestle Company and Grumman Aircraft developed his apti-tude
for progressive management.
&quot;Our Village operates under three categories for accounting pur-poses,
&quot; said the Purchasing Agent,&quot; namely Municipal, Electric and
Water. Purchases total more than two arid.&#x27;one-half &quot;million &quot;Hollars
annually. &quot;
&quot;Municipal--with purchases of about one-quarter of a million doll-ars
a year--includes the office of the Mayor, Board of Trustees,
Police Justice, Village Counsel, Treasurer and Village Clerk, the
Printshop, Garage and Purchasing Agent, and the Police, Fire,
Building, Recreation, Meter, Highway, Sign, Park-Stadium, Sani-tation,
Sewer arid Incinerator Departments, supported by tax revenues.
&quot;The purchases of the Electric Department amount to nearly two
million dollars a year, but it is self-sustained by revenues for elec-tric
service. The, Power Plant, Line Distribution and Tree-Trim-ming
units are in this group.
&quot;Water revenues during the past year were more than adequate to
pay for its. $387, 713 purchases of new and larger water mains and
make it also self-sustaining.
&quot;Each requisition we receive is typed on white or colored paper to
identify its origin: White for Municipal, blue for Electric and yellow
.for..Water Department,/1 .said Mr. Keir:nan._ __ „_ ^
&quot;Purchasing requires more than one man. It involves department
heads, commissioners, sales engineers and salesmen. Many times
the Village Counsel comes into the picture for contracts and/or legal
advice.
&quot;Competitive bids are necessary for purchase of materials costing
$1, 000 or more, and for public works $2,500 or over. The Mayor and
Trustees open these bids at a public meeting legally advertised in
advance, awarding the contract to the lowest responsible bidder.
Purchases less,£than $1, 000 are directed by me to the responsible
vendor supplying best quality,.service and price. I insist upon demon- .
stration and test of materials not previously bought or tried.
&quot;Standardization is recognized &quot;as a real key to economy. I believe
in volume buying when the item is used often and in large numbers.
When possible, however, we do business with Freeport firms. More
than 300 vendors sell to the Village government.
/&quot;The Village maintains a s tor eroo.nl &#x27;where articles and materials
frequently required are available. This enables us to buy in quan-tity
at great savings. A new system of recording stock on IBM cards,
updated each month, provides a handy account of what&#x27;s in the store-room.
Some people have the mistaken idea that only Electric Depart-ment
items are kept in the storeroom. Actually it stocks supplies
for all departments.&quot;
Vendors&#x27; claims for payments are watched by Mr. Keirnan&#x27;s
chief assistant to make sur(e the Village receives correct charges and
discounts where granted. She also handles the processing of all bid
proposals and legal notices published in the local paper.s. There is
one other assistant, who types all orders and receiving reports as
well as filing all papers of record. , . ., .
The.State Board of Audit and Control, which makes a careful
checkup every two years, has offered very little criticism of Free-port&#x27;s
Purchasing Department at any time in the past 10 years.

.BOAT.-LAUNGHING SITE (Continued from Page 1 )
litres for .a .good launching site. Despite the fact that the area had
been used as. a .village dump, it was believed this fact would- serve .
as an example of what could be done in similar comrnunitie&#x27;s.
A lease was drawn up in December, 1961. The 4 1/2 acre parcel
of land; including about 700 feet of water frontage on Stadium Park
Canal in Middle Bay, was leased to the Department without cost for
25 years. The Village agreed to assume the operation and mainten-ance
responsibilities once the area was developed by the State.
The first phase in development of the site has been completed
and includes a~ graveled parking. ar-ea-f or- 8.5_car_s,-.and trailers, two
40-foot -wide reinforced concrete ramps to accommodate the simul-taneous
launching or retrieving of four boats, and 700 feet of bulk-heading,
which not only serves to protect the waterfront and ramps,
but also provides temporary docking space. Appropriate lawn areas
have been established and landscaped. Metal ladders were secured
along the bulkheading for boarding and disembarking at. low tide,
and a stone walk skirts the entire docking area. The Village of
Freeport has generously donated appropriate lighting facilities.
Appropriate rules and regulations for controlling use of the stfe
are conspicuously posted and enforced by the Village of Freeport.
At present the area can be used by the transient boater without
difficulty because the basic facility for launching and parking has
been accomplished. However, restroom facilities will be added this
year and blacktopping of the parking area done as State funds permit.

&quot;KNOW YOUR VILLAGE&quot; PROGRAM ANNOUNCED
By official action at its meeting Jiily 20 the Freeport Village
Board launched a new educational program which will be called &quot;Know
Your Village.&quot;
&quot;There is a two-fold reason for the program, &quot; said&#x27;Truste.e
Frank W. Somers, creator of the idea. &quot;One is the boom in Free-port&#x27;s
population^ We are growing at the rate of 2, 000 a year. Since
the I960 census we have grown from about 32, 000 to 40, 000 approx-imate
population. At the same time.our Village government is grow-ing
more and more complex. It follows that most newcomers-, and1,
many of the older residents, are not fully informed about the scope
and nature of their Village&#x27;s, government.
&quot;The Village Board is launching this program to make it .poss.-
ible for m.en, women and children to go-behind the scenes and actu-ally
see their Village at work. It will bring them first-hand, intimate
details of the working of the various commissions, boards and depart-ments.
The program will supply a growing stream of pertinent in-formation,
to the end that citizens will begetter informed, more
interested in their government and better equipped to participate in
Village affairs.&quot; . ? . . - &#x27; .
The program will have three major divisions: (1) A speakers
bureau, (2) Guided tours and (3) Printed information.
I. Speakers Bureau. Top officials throughout the government ;
will be available to all community groups, including civic associ- I
ations, service clubs, fraternal organizations, church groups. Scout j
and other youth group meetings--even school classrooms. Village )
officials, responding with great enthusiasm, have submitted many
interesting subjects from which a choice may be made. To obtain
any of the speakers, groups are requested to contact the Village
Clerk, preferably in writing, at the Village Hall. State the subject
desired, time and date when wanted, name and nature of organiza-tion.
Advance notice is of course necessary. Speaking engagements
(Continued on Page 2)
&quot;KNOW YOUR VILLAGE&quot; (Continued from Page 1 )
can be arranged only if a speaker is available on the date desired.
For this reason, please suggest an alternate subject.
II. Guided Tours. Details of these will be announced in the next
issue of &quot;Village News.&quot; The program, on request, will offer guided
tours of interesting activities and installations such as Village Hall,
the Police Department, Sanitation Department, Sewage Disposal Plant,
Municipal Garage, Power Plant, Village parks, public housing and
other subjects. Groups such as Scouts, classroom units, adult
organizations and others may arrange for tours in advance.
III. Printed Information. This portion of the program will pro-vide
news stories, printed pages for distribution during tours and by
speakers, and other material to be taken home for study by the fam-ily
at leisure.
.&quot;This program of information and education is a fine idea--I&#x27;m all
for it,&quot; stated Mayor Sweeney. &quot;We&#x27;ll start with the three divisions
of the program outlined here, expanding as we go along. The Speakers
Bureau will be the answer to every program chairman&#x27;s prayer. The
Guided Tours will be a boon to adult clubs, youth organizations,
teachers and students. The literature feature will provide a flow of
factual information of a type never before made available. Sugges-tions
from citizens for expanding or improving the plan will be
welcomed. All Freeporters are invitied to take advantage of this
opportunity to &quot;Know Your Village. &quot;

floods or, at least, unsightly puddles.

FREEPORT BOAT-LAUNCHING SITE
(Reprinted in part from the Conservationist, a magazine
published by the State Conservation Department)
Authors: Maurice S. Otis, Supervisor, Stream
Improvement, and Richard England. Sr. Engineering
Technician
Long Island and the nearby metropolitan area, with its rapidly
expanding population, are naturally attracted to the recr-eation oppor-tunities
offered by nearby waters. Residents have been taking to the
coastal waterways for fun and fishing like ducks to water. Indeed,
more than 40 per cent of the registered boaters in New York State
reside in and around New York City.
The Conservation Department, in 1959, became responsible not
only for the registration, safety and education of our boaters, but
also for providing public access to strategic fishing and boating
waters in New York State. The job is now well started by a public
launching site dedicated by Conservation Commissioner Harold G.
Wilm on May 9.
The main problems of providing public access on Long Island
are the land acquisition and development costs. Prices of waterfront
properties, particularly on Long Island, have increased from modest
1 evels 30 years ago to rates that are comparable to those of choice
housing or industrial sites.
In order to start the public boating opportunities, a pilot model
launching site was needed. Such a site would need parking space for
large numbers of cars and trailers, ramps suitable for launching
regardless of tides and wave action, temporary docking facilities
for loading and unloading gear and easy access from a connecting
public highway system that permitted hauling of boat trailers. And it
should offer access to prime fishing and recreation waters.
The Village of Freeport authorities were the first to come forward
with an area suitable in size which also offered all the other potential-

<dc:description>&#x27; PEDESTRIAN SAFETY CITATION
For helping to avoid accidents to pedestrians in 1963, Freeport
has received a citation -- in plaque form -- from the American
Automobile Association.-Reports from 1, 557 U.S. communities
were evaluated by national leaders in highway and safety engineering,
motor vehicle administration, public education and traffic safety.
Activities here in making the Village safe for people on foot
were rated outstanding for a community of less than 50, 000. Pedes-trian
safety pamphlets are issued to local organizations, news-pa
per s-arid_radio stations are given educational articles, and talks
by Police Chief Peter Elar or his assistants emphasize protection
for persons crossing streets. Except for one fatality in I960, the
Village had no deaths from accidents to pedestrians from 1958 until
last year.
GROUNDBREAKING FOR INDUSTRIAL PARK
Thursday, September 24, will be an important milestone in
Freeport&#x27;s campaign to keep the tax rate down by adding new tax-able
property to the rolls and at the same time increase employ-ment
opportunities in the community. On Sept. 24 at 11 o&#x27;clock in
the morning. State, County and local notables will participate in a
groundbreaking ceremony on the Freeport Industrial Park site near
the foot of Albany Ave. at Buffalo Ave. extension. The public is
invited to attend.
Two companies have already agreed to build, in the non-profit
industrial center, plants with a combined valuation estimated at
$650. 000. Others are expected to join them on the rest of the 10-
acre Village-owned site. Last month the two companies were gran-ted
15-year four and one-quarter per cent second mortgage loans
by the State Job Development Authority to help finance the cost of
land and buildings.
The industrial park grew out of efforts by a business and in-dustrial
committee which Mayor Robert J. Sweeney appointed in
1961. When the State JDA was established a year or so later, the
local committee took steps to form Long Island&#x27;s first Local Deve-lopment
Corporation. The nine officers and directors, headed by
Roy N. Cacciatore, serve without compensation.
#####
LEAF-BURNING TABOO
Smoke from burning leaves is expected to become as rare as
Indian smoke-signals in Freeport. New trucks, acquired recent-ly
by the Village, will work like vacuum cleaners in picking up
leaves this autumn. Residents are urged to rake or sweep accum-lations
of leaves into the gutter to be picked up by these new veh-icles.
An ordinance prohibits the burning of leaves.

:&quot;-} the Recreation Department office will be featured.
On the second floor open house will be held by the Mayor, Trus-tees
and a number of department heads in the large Conference Room
where the Village Board convenes. Visitors wishing to meet the offi-cials
will have an opportunity to do so, or may listen in on some of
the discussions going on at various places in the room. (Continued)
Here will be found the heads of departments whose headquarters are
located outside Village Hall: Superintendents of Highways, Sanitation,
Electricity, Water, Parks and Sewers, and members of the Freeport
Housing Authority.
Elsewhere on the second floor are the Building Department, Pur-chasing
Department, Urban Renewal office and others. Short talks on
their work will be given. The offices of the Mayor and Village Coun-sel
may also be seen.
This seems an appropriate season to launch such an educational
program. Just 72 years ago, on the last day in September, our fore-fathers
were completing preparations for incorporating the commun-ity
into a Village --a goal which won support of the taxpayers and
was finally attained through the filing of incorporation papers Oct-tober
22, 1892.
A large municipal parking field north of the building will provide
convenient space for cars.
&quot;Know Your Village&quot; Tours
An opportunity to see &quot;behind the scenes&quot; will be offered to Free-porters
in a series of tours starting in October. These guided trips
are open to groups upon request. They include such places as the
Power Plant, Sanitation Department (with new Incinerator) , Sewage
Disposal Plant, Municipal Garage public housing facilities, Village
Hall and Police Department. Adult or youth organizations are invi-ted
to arrange for tours by contacting the Village Clerk&#x27;s office in
writing or by telephoning FR 8-4000.
Speakers&#x27; Bureau
The newly formed Speakers&#x27; Bureau will serve all community
groups and is available to the Board of Education. Top officials
throughout the local government have enthusiastically submitted
many interesting subjects from which a choice may be made. To ob-tain
any of the speakers, groups are requested to contact the Village
Clerk in writing or by phone. Advance notice is of course necessary.
Please suggest an alternate subject when&quot; you call for any &quot;topic ~,&#x27; so&#x27;
that the possibility of obtaining a speaker on the particular date will
be increased.
For convenience of program chairmen a preliminary list of topics
printed in the August &quot;Village News&quot; is republished:
&quot;Purchasing Procedures,&quot; &quot;Zoning and Building Enforcement,&quot;
&quot;Freeport Parking Problems,&quot; &quot;How the Police Department Operates,
&quot;Youth Problems,&quot; &quot;Police Court,&quot; &quot;Treasurer&#x27;s and Accounting
Office Modernization &quot;,&quot;Fire Prevention,&quot; &quot;Safety Demonstration &quot;
&quot;First Aid and Rescue &quot; &quot;Firemen&#x27;s Training &quot; &quot;The Master Plan
and Zoning Revisions, &quot; &quot;Traffic. Safety, V &quot;Public Housing in Free-port,
&quot; &quot;Operation of the Zoning Board,&quot; &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot;
&quot;Sanitation Department Improvements,&quot; &quot;How the Sewer Department
Operates,&quot; &quot;The New Nordberg Engine,&quot; &quot;Water Main Moderniza-tion,&quot;
&quot;Higher-Voltage Lines&quot; and &quot;Your Highway Department.&quot;
ANOTHER STEP FORWARD
You may have noticed Electric Department employees, wear-ing
yellow safety hats, at work in the central business area. They
were installing cable underground to bring power more efficiently
over Freeport1 s primary distribution lines. The 2400-volt system,
a major improvement more than 30 years ago, is being stepped up
to 4160 volts--a necessary step in keeping pace with the continued
growth of our Village&#x27;s electricity consumption.
Higher voltage will insure better operation of electrical appli-ances
while increasing efficiency of the system, by reducing &quot;line
loss.&quot; No changes are required in customer connections.
This work follows the construction of Substation &quot;D, &quot; which
was built at Front St. and South Ocean Avenue to handle the higher
voltage. Two other substations are already operating at 4160 volts.
It is expected that the fourth substation will be converted some-time
early next year, thereby completing the change-over to more
efficient distribution. #*##*

<dc:description>THE PARK COMMISSION (Continued from Page 2)
x &quot;All-night lighting has drastically reduced vandalism and del-inquency,
&quot; said Mr. Messing. &quot;Police call-boxes in all parks can
be used in emergencies by the public as well as by patrolmen who
make calls directly into police headquarters.
&quot;The Park Department maintains numerous landscaped spots:
the Village Green on North Ocean Avenue; Memorial Library
grounds; State boat-launching site on Albany Avenue; a lawn, tree
and shrubbery strip along Brooklyn Avenue; north side of Sunrise
Highway from Bayview to Brookside Avenues; triangle at Sunrise
Highway and Center Street, shrubbery-and-bench area at Free-port
Plaza West and Main Street; Liberty Avenue Park, the Little
League official field south of Firemen&#x27;s Field and eight Little
League diamonds in the parks.&quot;
Recently a boccie (rolling ball game) site was selected at
Randall Park. In the three other major parks, Northeast, North-west
and Waterfront, additional barbecue pits were provided.
Softdrink and candy vending machines are planned in several
parks. The Commission chairman said:
&quot;The boat-launching ramp at Waterfront Park was taken out
because the mouth of the creek is too narrow. Freeporters i have
easy access to the new State ramps on Albany Avenue and the
County ramp on Milburn Creek at Atlantic Avenue.
&quot;Superintendent Combs has under his direction one foreman, a
full-time supervisor at each of the four major parks, and five lab-orers,
supplemented by summer help. These men recently gained
a five-day work week. Recreation Superintendent Richardson has
a program supervisor, secretary, typist and part-time staff
under his direction.
&quot;For a community of Freeport&#x27;s size the standard set by the
National Recreation Association is 400 acres. Our Village owns
60 acres, while in addition there are about 65 acres of New York
City Water Department property, some of&quot; it employed for parks
like Firemen&#x27;s Field and one site in the preparation stage, Hanse
Park.
The National Recreation Association recently honored Mr.
Messing and indirectly Freeport&#x27;s park program, by awarding
him a citation for his &quot;outstanding contribution to recreation.&quot;

BETTER STREET LIGHTING PAYS DIVIDENDS
A Freeport dream became reality during the past month when
our Village Electric Department completed the installation of Z, 069
mercury street light fixtures. Most of these replaced filament bulbs,
while others were placed in new locations. The 10-year program&#x27;s
completion makes ours the first New York State municipality, with
a population of more than 7, 000, to achieve &quot;minimum code levels&quot;
of the American Standards Association and the Illuminating Engin-eering
Society.
Better illumination isn&#x27;t the only gain, with its effect last year
of reducing robberies, bicycle-auto accidents and collisions causing
vehicular property damage. Taxpayers will find a benefit, too, as
mercury lamps last four or five times as long as the filament type
and produce about three and one -half times as much lig] :er watt.

LEAF &#x27;VACUUM CLEANERS&#x27; TO START ROUNDS IN OCTOBER
On or about October 15 when the leaf-raking season begins, the
Highway Department will start collecting leaves from the gutter.
Residents, when they rake or sweep leaves into the gutter, are
urged to keep branches and other foreign matter out, as such mater-ials
create a problem for the vacuum machines and slow down collec-tions.
Two new &quot;vacuum&quot; trucks will be assisted by two other trucks.
Until the one-a-week special pickups start, people should place
leaves in containers at the curb for Wednesday trash collections. An
ordinance prohibits the burning of leaves.
THE PARK COMMISSION
Under the Park Commission&#x27;s jurisdiction come two entirely
different departments -- one for parks and the other for recre-ation.
Theodore Combs is Superintendent of the 37-year-old
Park Department while Walter F. Richardson heads the Recre-ation
Department, organized only 11 years ago.
Mannie Messing, chairman of the Commission, and his asso-ciates
have found time not only to help bring about improvements
in Freeport&#x27;s four major parks and expand the recreation program,
but also to keep in touch with the needs of our fast-growing Vjllage.
&quot;Sit-in parks like Prospect Park (on Randall Bay) and Grove-
East have become very popular,&quot; said Mr. Messing. &quot;Question-naires
showed that people in the neighborhood of Prospect Park
wanted a place to rest, chat or take their baby-carriages. Most
homes in that area have backyard play spaces, some with swings
and other facilities.
&quot;Donations of trees, shrubs, etc, for beautifying these spots
have already been offered. Grove-East-Park will soon be renamed
William J. Martin Sr. Park at the request of the Exchange Club,
which will donate a drinking fountain. Mr. Martin&#x27;s widow has
contributed funds for a flagpole. Since Village employees made
the benches, paths and other items at low cost, these parks on sites
already owned by the Village are truly &#x27;home-made. &#x27;
&quot;A valuable addition will be Hanse Park, now undergoing site
improvement in a alow but economical way on Mill Road east of
Main Street. The Highway Department grades this 10 1/2 acre site
with clean fill which is brought there free of charge by contractors.
Picnic areas, barbecue pits, a tiny tot playground, senior sit-in
section, indoor games and restrooms are among the improvements
planned, plus a restroom sometime in the future.
The Park Commission looks upon Freeport Stadium as a rev-enue
producer which deserves capital improvements. The Village
Board has approved the construction of two restroom buildings --
one under the stand near the Buffalo Avenue entrance, the other
north of the pit area--and a new front wall about 12 feet high, with
lettering &quot;Freeport Municipal Stadium&quot; and flags on the Mill Road
side along with a small office building.
At no cost to the Village the Kedenberg Racing Association has
provided a brand-new track and a new public address system. In
years of favorable weather, attendance at paid attractions alone
reaches 210, 000 -- mostly for stock car races but also for boxing,
wrestling, midget auto racing and antique displays. High School
football, graduation exercises, the Firemen&#x27;s Independence Day
fireworks and baseball use the Stadium. Whenever food is pur -
chased there, the Village gets a percentage from concession-naires.
Revenues gross about $104, 000 annually, but out of this
the Village must pay for maintenance and many other costs.
(Continued on Page 4)
OUR INDUSTRIAL PARK
Groundbreaking
ceremonies for
Freeport Industrial
Park, on Buffalo
Avenue Extension
south of the Muni-cipal
Stadium, cli-maxed
a year of
effort to convert
idle Village-owned
land into tax-yield-ing
property. The
site&#x27;s first two
plants will have a
controlled architec-tural
design and a combined cost of $650, 000. Their 100 workers at
the outset are expected to increase through plant expansion. When
fully developed, the 10-acres will provide from 500 to 1, 000 jobs,
and buildings with a valuation of nearly two million dollars.
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney praised the cooperation shown by &quot;all
segments of our population -- the civic and business leaders, the
official family, homeowners and others&quot; -- which &quot;serves as a cata-lyst
for revitalization of the community.&quot;
In 1961 Mayor Sweeney appointed a Business and Industrial Deve-lopment
Committee which had as its chief tasks the improvement of .
the business climate, the creation of job opportunities and the in-vestigation
of means to obtain additional sources of revenue to ease
the tax burden upon homeowners and other taxpayers. From the com-mittee
evolved the idea of applying to the State Job Development
Authority for aid. The IDA recently approved very nominal-rate
second mortgage loans totalling $195, 000 to help pay the cost of the
two plants.
**&amp;*&amp;
NO TRASH PICK-UP OCT. 14. NOV. 4 AND NOV. 11 :
. As stated in last month&#x27;s &quot;Village News,11 there will be no curb
collection of trash Wednesday, Oct. 14, because of Columbus Day.
The usual Monday garbage collection is scheduled, on Tuesday, and
the regular Tuesday one on Wednesday.
Changes will also take place Nov. 4 (the day after Election Day)
and Wednesday, Nov. 11 (Veterans Day). Trash NORTH of Merrick
Road will be picked up Nov. 4, 5 and 6, while trash SOUTH of
Merrick Road will be collected Nov. 12 and 13. In this way only one
of the two normal pickups will be eliminated.
Garbage collections ordinarily made on Tuesday (Election Day)
will be performed Wednesday, Nov. 4. The Thursday and Friday
pick-ups in all these holiday weeks will be normal.</dc:description>

Harry Chuisano tells how
new Village truck works &#x27;-
like huge vacuum cleaner in
picking up leaves. This veh-icle

,.,-..*. IT&#x27;S UNLAWFUL: TO BURN LEAVES
Why risk a fine when the Village will gladly pick up leaves you
place in the gutter ? Two trucks work like big vacuum cleaners in
making collections. When you rake leaves into the gutter, please
keep them free of branches and other foreign matter so that the
machines can do a good job. Let&#x27;s help the vacuum trucks, Free-port&#x27;s
prescription for an autumn without the air pollution caused by
dangerous fires.

SANITATION SCHEDULES CHANGED BY HOLIDAYS
Because of holiday weeks there will be changes in the Freeport
trash pickups that would usually take place on Nov. 4, 11, and 25.
Please try to withold trash until a normal collection at the curb
on Wednesday, Nov. 18, but if necessary you may take advantage of
this emergency schedule:
NORTH OF MERRICK ROAD (no collection the week of Nov^ 9) —
Please put out trash Tuesday evening, Nov. 3, at the curb for pickup
Nov. 4, 5 or 6, depending upon when the trucks reach your&#x27;area.
SOUTH OF MERRICK ROAD (No trash collection the week of
Nov. 2)-- Kindly put out trash Wednesday evening, Nov. 11, for pickup
Nov. 12 or 13, depending upon when the trucks reach your area.
Garbage collections will be normal with these exceptions:
Instead of collecting garbage on Election Day, the department
will do so Wednesday, Nov. 4.
There will be no garbage pickup on Thanksgiving Day. Instead,
the Sanitation-Department men will come around on Wednesday, Nov.
26. But they will make no collection of trash that week.

TALL SHRUBS CAN BE A MENACE
Hedges and shrubs more than three feet higher than the sidewalk
at or near street corners are a threat to traffic safety, homeowners
were reminded in an interview with &quot;Village News&quot; by Milton Danziger^
chairman of the Traffic Safety Committee.
Warning that fences, hedges or plants (other than shade trees)
must be kept below three feet to comply with a Village ordinance, Mr.
Danziger said the law applies within a triangular area formed by
drawing a line between points on the street lines 30 feet from a street
intersection. He urged that every owner of a corner home obey the
regulations in order to prevent injury and possible loss of life to per-sons
in cars approaching the corner.

NO TRASH PICKU*P**S* D* EC. 23 AND 30
The regular pickups of trash in two holiday weeks, on Dec. 23
and 30, will be omitted. Sanitation men will make their usual Thurs-day
collections of garbage on Wednesdays and their usual Friday gar-bage
pickups on Thursdays. Any Christmas boxes or gift wrappings
put at the curb for- a garbage collection day will be picked up that day.
RULES ON ROOMERS AND ONE -FAMILY HOUSES
Because of an influx of relief families into Freeport and the be-lief
of some citizens that rooming laws are not being observed by
all, Mayor Robert J. Sweeney has asked Building Supt. William Noll
to restate local laws on the subject;
&quot;No more than one room for lodging or boarding purposes may
be rented in any dwelling, to -a total of up to tw,o persons, provided . .
that such persons do not have separate cooking facilities arid do not
do independent cooking on the premises.
&quot;The only two-family houses permitted under the ordinances are
&#x27;non-conforming1 ones which either existed before zoning went into
effect or were constructed under regulations permitting them on
plots of a certain minimum area prior to I960.
&quot;Our zoning ordinance contains a specific definition of a family:
&#x27;One or more persons related by blood, marriage or adoption, living
and cooking, or warming food, as a single housekeeping unit. A
family, if consisting of more than one person, shall consist of: (1) A
husband and wife, (2) Parent or parents and child or children and /or
grandchild or grandchildren, and/or grandparent or grandparents
(3) Brother and/or brothers. (4) Sister and/or sisters, (5) Brother

DECEMBER, 1964
KEEPING PACE WITH ELECTRICITY NEEDS
The Municipal Power Plant has put into successful operation
its new generating unit, the largest stationary Diesel engine genera-ting
unit east of the Mississippi. Tests showed that the Freeport
engine&#x27;s output exceeds specifications. A 10-cylinder Nordberg
drives a Westinghouse 5,150-kilowatt generator, capable of producing
10 per cent overload for limited periods.
In its program to reduce operating costs, Freeport purchased
the new unit for operation on No. 6 residual oil which has been quoted
here at less than six cents per gallon, compared to about eight cents
for the type of oil it will replace. • ...
Village officials expect to save more than $100, 000 in fuel costs
per year. Piping modifications are being completed and use of lower
cost fuel in the three newest engines is scheduled for the end of
this year.
The bases of three older units were removed to make way for the
new one which measures 47 feet long and weighs 225 tons. Its 357-
cubic-yard concrete foundation has a weight of 714 tons.
This 7,150-horsepower Nordberg has turbochargers which use
waste gases to increase power output. A scavenger air blower, motor,
etc., have been installed in space provided by remodelling the former
shallow well pump basement. The generating unit contains an auto-matic
heater that keeps the engine, while turned off, up to approxi-mate
running temperature.
Electricity from the Power Plant was supplied in November to
12,103 residential and 1,434 commercial and industrial consumers.
THE POLICE JUSTICE
Because so many Freeporters keep out of trouble, very few know
that Police Justice Edwin J0 Freedman holds court every morning at
8 o&#x27;clock, including weekends and holidays, whenever during the
previous 24 hours there has been an arrest over which the Freeport
Police Court has jurisdiction,,
Although District Courts of Nassau County handle civil cases,
and criminal offenses punishable by imprisonment more than one
year, the Village&#x27;s Police Justice is responsible for all violations of
the Vehicle and Traffic Law (except drunken driving) and Village
ordinances,,
In addition, Police Justice Freedman metes out penalties for
speeding or excessive wake of boats, based upon summonses issued
by the Nassau- County Polic.e_,water_patrpl0 During the summer these
cases range from three to 10 per week in the local court0
Among the most frequent non -vehicular charges are those against
dog-owners for pets running at large or objectionable barkings
against persons who fail to obtain the necessary Village permits of
various kinds, against violators of the zoning ordinances or the
building, plumbing or electrical codes, and public intoxication and
disorderly conduct cases,,
The heaviest work-load in Police Court results from auto vio-lations,,
In an effort to encourage obedience to traffic laws Judge
Freedman has installed a bulletin board in the lobby of Police
Court where headlines on news stories of serious accidents show
his &quot;customers&quot; the danger of disobeying traffic rules,,
When summonses are ignored, the court follows through as
diligently as it can to enforce warrants of arrest. Freeport and
Nassau police cooperate, as well as the Police Court staff of three
women,,
If a person arraigned pleads innocent, Judge Freedman tries to
help him avoid losing time from workff Choice of an afternoon or
night trial is given0 When enough defendants seek a night trial, a
session is arranged on Thursday evening,, Normally, twice a month,
the court holds a Friday afternoon trial session at 2 o&#x27;clock.
Judge Freedman&#x27;s work as chairman of the Mayor&#x27;s Committee
for Youth has heightened the demand for him to speak before local
organizations on youth problems and related topics. The committee
recently helped teen-agers to form the Freeport Council of Youth
which participates in worthwhile community activities,. The commit r

As Spring arrives, the Village Board is already working on an au-tumn
problem -- the removal of leaves. Treasurer Leonard D. B.
Smith was authorized to prepare a $10, 000 bond issue for necessary
leaf-pickup equipment... Nassau County Public Works Department
has announced it wishes to install new curbs this summer oh South
Main Street from a point 250 feet south of Merrick Road to Sunrise
Highway. The Village, therefore, must replace facilities supplying
utilities there.

RECREATION MONTH
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney has proclaimed June as National Rec-reation
Month. He urges all citizens to participate in thewmany pro-grams
offered by Freeport&#x27;s Recreation Department during June.
****** &#x27; . . .
RELIGHTING PROGRAM (Continued from Page 3)
Freeport&#x27;s present lighting is the result of 11 years of hard work
and planning. First improvement was in 1954 when 416 400-watt
mercury luminaires were installed in the heart of the business dis-trict.
Now a total of 2, 144 mercury luminaires brighten this Long Island
village. Of these, 1,092 carry 400-watt lamps and the rest are 175-
watts. Larger-wattage lamps are in the business areas and on major
highways. Total wattage is 620, 900.
These new lights replace up to 30-year-old luminaires ranging
from 200 to 300-watts. Since mercury lights burn longer than fila-ment
bulbs and produce more lumens per watt, residents feel the
investment has been worthwhile.
Fewer Robberies and Accidents
It&#x27;s too early to assess all the results, but current evidence is
gratifying. Police records for 1963 showed a 64% drop in robberies;
a 23% decrease in bicycle and motor vehicle accidents, and 6% less
night-time accidents causing vehicular damage. All this is despite
a sizeable yearly increase in traffic.
Improved lighting is Freeport&#x27;s four major parks has drastically
reduced vandalism there.
Spacing betwe&#x27;en lamp installations averages 125 feet staggered in
business areas and ranges-from 200 to 300 feet in residential sections.
Poles in the business areas (Underground service) are aluminum,
while wood poles predominate in residential districts.
A total of $373,143 has been invested by Freeport&#x27;s Electric De-partment
in relighting. Although operating costs are low, it&#x27;s too
early for comparative figures.
However, with this relighting, Freeport has been able to stay &quot;The
Boating and Fishing Capital of the East&quot; 24 hours a day.

FREEPQRT RELIGHTING PROGRAM INCLUDES
BOAT RAMPS AND WATERWAYS
(Reprinted from Street and Highway Lighting magazine, a
national periodical, by permission)
A bright reflection from new lights shines on the waterways of
Freeport, Long Island, as well as on its streets and highways.
With 17 miles of navigable waterfront within its Village limits,
Freeport is tabbed as &quot;The Boating and Fishing Capital of the East. &quot;
So it made sense that plans for modern mercury lighting in the Vil-lage
should include not only thoroughfares and side streets, but docks
and boat-launching ramps as well. .
Today, three 4, 000-watt lights assist night-time sailors at the Al-bany
Avenue ramp site while 37 ornamental luminaires light County-owned
Milburn Park and its ramp. .There are also new lights along
mile-and-a-quarter Woodcleft Canal and other busy sections.
The result of this well-planned system is a breath-taking view for
the many visitors who come to this South Shore Long Island commun-ity
via water. . . .. , . , .
But water-lighting is by no means the only area which Freeport has
improved. The Village&#x27;s system also encompasses its business dis-trict,
residential areas, highways and parks.
A pioneer in street lighting, Freeport installed its first system in
1898 -- 24 carbon units.
Since then, the community has tried to keep pace with modern
lighting developments, as well as the growing need of Freeport&#x27;s
increasing population. Today it boasts 42,000 residents, making it
the largest incorporated village in New York State.

NEW APPROACH TO TRAFFIC SAFETY
The Freeport Police Court has decided to attack poor driving at
its roots. A Traffic Safety Clinic, starting Jan. 21, will explain
driver faults, causes of accidents and important provisions of traffic
laws. :
Police Justice Edwin J. Freedman may give traffic violators
special consideration in imposing sentences if they produce Clinic
Attendance Certificates. Sentencing will be adjourned after they
plead guilty, to let the drivers benefit from a one-and-one.-half hour
-session in the courtroom. Each month there will be a clinic for a
new group of motor vehicle operators who agree to attend the educa-tional
session.
Rockville Centre and Hempstead courts are cooperating in the
experiment. All three judges agree this new approach will probably
do more to improve driving habits than merely imposing a fine.
~ &quot; The clinic, which will also include a&#x27;traffic -education film and
true-false quizzes, is under the direction of Mrs. George Maynes,
assisted by George Moser and George Emma of the High School
Driver Educational Program and Police Captain Edward S. Dixon.
All serve without compensation, using materials furnished by C.
Edwin Max, Associate Director of the State Traffic Safety Council.

YOUTH CENT-ER DEDICATION JAN. 10
The long-felt need for a youth center has been met by opening of
the new Village of Freeport Recreation Center, 61 Pine Street. First
major step taken to provide all young people in the community with a
place to go, be seen and have fun, the well equipped 6, 000-square-foot
establishment is proudly announced by
the Village administration.
Dedication ceremonies will take place
Sunday, Jan. 10, at 2 P. M. The public is
cordially invited. In view of the many organ-izations
and individuals who have expressed
hope for the creation of such a recreation
center, it is anticipated the ceremonies will
draw a sizeable turnout of interested citizens.
A modern jukebox with the latest record-ings,
television, billiards, arts and crafts
and many other associated activities will be
available. Facilities include an art room,
two rooms for games,a teen-age lounge and
an all-purpose room. Groups are planned in
the following subjects: Modern dancing, be-ginners&#x27;
drama, introduction to the piano,
sculpture in clay, sketching, interior decoration and others.
The hours on Monday through Friday will be 3:30 to 5 P.M. and
7 to 9 P. M. , except that on Friday the Center will remain open until
10 P. M. The busiest day will probably be Saturday, so the hours that
day will start at 3 P. M. , continue until 5 and reopen in the evening
from 7 to 10 o&#x27;clock.
A product of combined effort by numerous organizations and indiv-iduals,
the Recreation Center was brought into being by the Park Com-mission,
the Mayor&#x27;s Committee for Youth, Freeport&#x27;s Council for

SNQWED-IN CARS BLOCK STREETS
Freeport needs a lot of good citizens this winter. You&#x27;re a good
citizen if you get your car off the street prior to a snow storm.
That&#x27;s one way of doing something about the weather.
It is predicted that this winter the total snowfall will be abnorm-ally
heavy* We must keep roads clear so that snow ploughs can do
their job unhindered. Milton Danziger, chairman of the Traffic Safe-ty
Committee, pointed out that in letting the Highway Department
do a quick, efficient job of ploughing, good citizens also avoid the
need to dig their autos out of snowbanks created along the curb by
snow -clearing vehicles.
Anyone whose car interferes with efficient snow removal hurts
the entire community.

STATEWIDE HONOR
The Sewer Department -- and Freeport -- won a real distinction
in November. Richard Pretsch, Junior Chemist at the local treat-ment
plant, received a cup awarded by the New York State Pollution
Control Association for the best one-year operating report submitted
to the association. Mayor Robert J. Sweeney presented this honor to
Mr. Pretsch at a meeting of the Statewide group&#x27;s Long Island Sec-tion

HAVE YOU REGISTERED YOUR BICYCLE FOR 1965 ?
Bicycle owners in Freeport are required by a Village ordinance
to register them with the Police Department. For 25 cents each
bicycle owner will be given a certificate of registration and a license
plate. Renewable every year, this license identifies lost or stolen
bicycles.
Riders under 16 must carry a rider&#x27;s certificate. To obtain one,
children must pass a written test on the rules of the road conducted
by the schools and also a road test given by the Freeport Police. A

MODERN WATER PIPE INSTALLED
A water company elsewhere in Nassau County told Newsday re-cently
that it believes a project it has started will be the first instal-lation
of cement -lined iron pipe on Long Island. Just for the record
and without claiming a first, Freeport can truthfully reply that cement
lined cast iron mains were completed under contracts let by this
Village in 1962 when 6,400 feet were installed under three contracts —
on North Columbus Ave. , Archer St. and Pennsylvania Ave. -Lena
Ave.
Our Water Department specified similar pipe in 1964 for a 12-
inch main on Seaman Ave. from Main St. to Pennsylvania Ave.; a
ten-inch main on South Bayview Ave. from Ray St. to Atlantic Ave.
and from there to Milburn Creek bridge, and for work started Dec.
15 to provide an eight-inch line on Wilson Place from Pennsylvania
Ave. to North Long Beach Ave. Bids have been opened for a 12-inch
main consisting of cement-lined cast iron pipe on Pennsylvania Ave.
from Wilson Place to California Ave.</dc:description>

OUR RECREATION CENTER
Newspapers hailed the dedication Jan., 10 of Freeport&#x27;s Recre-ation
Center at 61 Pine Street, Hundreds of citizens attended the
ceremonies, despite a severe snowstorm,, Comment was made by
speakers that the center&#x27;s establishment marked a most important
step in the civic improvement of our Village,,
The Park Commission, other officials and civic-minded resi-dents
had analyzed many possible sites before taking the leadership
in what became a magnificent group effort,. How great the need had
become was shown when, during the first nine days, more than 700
young people registered for the ^program and attendance in that per-iod
alone totalled 2, 2100 . •
If enough interest is shown, the Recreation Department hopes to
extend the services of the center to other age groups,,

NO TAX INCREASE FOR COMING YEAR
In the 1965-66 Village budget, effective March 1, taxes remain
unchanged at the rate of $2. 57 per $100 assessed valuation,,
MOVING FORWARD ELECTRICALLY
Freeport&#x27;s population growth at the rate of about 2, 000 per year
since I960 has made our community the largest incorporated vill-age
in New York State. It has also required careful planning to keep
up with the spiralling need for electricity.
A big step toward solving the&#x27;problem was taken when our Vill-age
installed the largest stationary Diesel engine generating unit
west of the Mississippi River. Put to work last October, the new 7,-
150- horsepower Nordberg engine.and 5,150 - kilowatt Westinghbuse
generator have turned out more power than was required of them in
the specifications.
This year the conversion of all primary distribution cables from
2,400 to 4,160 volts will be completed. Three of our four substations
already operate at 4,160 volts, reducing &quot;line loss&quot; and insuring
better service of electrical appliances. A major spur toward the de -
velopment of electricity output has been an influx of industrial plants
into districts already zoned for such establishments.
Savings on oil used in the Power Plant will bring cheers from
Freeport taxpayers. Of the four generating units now in use, three
will operate on No. 6 residual oil which has been quoted locally at
less than six cents per gallon. The type of oil it will replace costs
about eight cents. It is estimated that the resulting economies in
fuel expenditures will amount to more than $100, 000 a year.
Turbochargers enable the new .Nordberg to use its own waste
gases in stepping up the output of power. An automatic heater keeps
the engine at almost running-temperature while inoperative.
- Other recent improvements include two new, larger transformers
and a 15-ton electric hoist in the Power Plant as well as draining
and grading of the grounds. Soon a central control annunciator will
give advance warning of faults in the production system.
Another outstanding accomplishment in autumn of 1964 was change-over
from filament bulb to mercury street lights. Started 11 years
ago, this project retired fixtures between 10 and 30 years old. Tak-ing
their place are more than 2,150 mercury street lamps -- about
1,100 of the 400-watt variety and 1, 060 rated at 175 watts. The mer-cury
type of lamp burns about six times as long and gives about
three times as much illumination per watt compared to filament bulbs.
Mark J. Hroncich heads a Board of Water and Light Commission-ers
which serves in an advisory capacity to Mayor Robert J. Sweeney

fight such an unwelcome trend by reporting any violations.
To help notify the proper authorities, a committee has been
formed with representatives from?the various sections and civic or-ganizations.
Facts given this committee will be turned over to the
authorities for investigation. -\ &#x27; • &quot; • &#x27; .

MARCH, 1965
DIRECT ATTACK LAUNCHED ON HOUSING VIOLATIONS
The administration of Mayor Robert Je Sweeney has announced a
new, direct three-step approach to the Northeast area&#x27;s problem of
neighborhood deterioration; (1) Thorough inspection of every home by
a Special Inspector to locate building, occupancy and other code viola-tions;
(2) Follow-through by approiate agencies of the Village to clear
up each situation, and (3) A demand to the new County Welfare Comm-issioner
for control of welfare placements in a manner to prevent addi&lt;
tional violations.
While efforts to obtain help from other levels of government will
continue, the Mayor said, Freeport will take immediate measures of
its own0 He added:
&quot;The Village has retained Mr. Peter A. Cattano to handle the in-spection
of homeso Mr. Cattano has three special qualifications„ He
is a building contractor, familiar with construction and Village codes,,
Second, he is a Freeport Housing Authority member 0 Third, he hap-pens
to be a prominent and active Democrat, a factor which I hope
will eliminate any suspicion that this program is in any way hostile to
the County Welfare Department or the County Administration. The
program aims to meet head-on a local problem without any reference
to race, color, creed or politics.
&quot;When action is required of a corrective nature, it will be handled
on a friendly, cooperative basis. In cases where absentee landlords
or others refuse to correct violations, strong action will be taken.
&quot;If the program succeeds in the Northeast area, we shall make
this a Village-wide project. It will get under way at once, just as soon
as the report forms and the procedures can be established,, I ask the
support and cooperation of every citizen.&quot;
The new effort will supplement a stepped =up inspection program
by the Building -Department, he added.
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
Sixty-one men give full-time service in the Freeport Police De-partment.
But that isn&#x27;t the entire staff. Probably few residents
know the department also has 30 special policemen on call for emerg-encies,
paid on an hourly basis; 17 part-time school crossing guards;
four women clerks in the records room, and two matrons hired only
when women are confined to the Village lockup.
Freeport can also call upon the County Police for men or equip -
ment when Chief Peter Elar finds that a genuine emergency exists.
This special aid, along with certain other services, is made poss-ible
by provisions of the Nassau County Charter.
Always eager to improve its police protection, the Village has
steadily built up one of the best departments in New York State. Last
September &quot;walkie-talkies&quot; for two foot patrolmen were provided, as
an experiment, with highly satisfactory results. The transceivers
enable policemen on walking beats to talk with each other, any patrol
car or headquarters. If a man on foot needs help, he can summon
aid without leaving the scene. The &quot;walkie-talkies&quot; have often proven
valuable --so much so that purchase of more is planned.
Freeport has led all other New York State communities in acquir-ing
four Canine Corps dogs, each handled by one policeman. Capt.
Edward S. Dixon heads this division, which patrols the Village gener-ally
and uses dogs for help only under the most unusual circumstances.
It would be impossible to list here all the awards earned by our
Police Department. Many of these are exhibited in trophy cases and
on the walls at headquarters. But an honor won in August, 1963, des-erves
mention because it reflects credit upon the entire community.
Rated fourth highest in the State for excellence of traffic proced-ures,
Freeport received an Award of Merit from the State Citizens
Council on Traffic Safety, as well as a plaque and seven books on
law enforcement.
Besides accident prevention, other factors considered by the
judges were traffic law enforcement, highway signs, street lighting,
signals, bicycle regulation, the work done by safety committees and
control of traffic at schools. Over a five-year period Freeport had an
excellent record in safeguarding pedestrians, with only one fatality
from 1958 to 1963.
&quot;The marksmanship of Freeport&#x27;s police has won many medals,&quot;
said Chief Elar. &quot;Talent is a big factor, of course, but much of the
credit must go to regular practice, gained at a revolver and rifle
range maintained by the policemen themselves.
&quot;A Perfect Record Certificate for safe driving was presented to
our department in November by the National Safety Council, for the
12-month period ending June, 1964, when 40 drivers operated 14 police
vehicles a total of 267, 908 miles.
&quot;The 61 men on pur regular force include the Chief, one Captain,
five lieutenants, five Sergeants, two Detectives, four Canine Corps
members and 43 other policemen. In the absence of the Chief and the
Captain, Lieutenants take temporary charge of the department.
&quot;At all times there is at least one Sergeant assigned to patrol,
for the purpose of supervising patrolmen on their rounds and checking
to see that proper procedures are followed. The department&#x27;s 16 mo-bile
units of autos and motorcycles are fully equipped with three-way
radios.
&quot;Under the Nassau County Charter a direct tax (part of the County
tax) on property is collected for services rendered to this community.
Specialists provided by Nassau include (1) Marine patrol, with head-quarters
on Hanse Avenue, comprising six boats assigned to Nassau&#x27;s
South Shore; (2) Highway patrol of any Freeport roads for traffic viola-tions;
(3) Detective service; (4) Vice, Burglary, Narcotics, Homicide
and Loft and Safe Squads&#x27; work; (5) Aid from the Youth Division, and
(6) Headquarters Division training of department members.&quot;
There were only five Freeport policemen when Chief Elar started
his work for the Village 47 years ago, after brief service as a special
Long Island Railroad policeman. Chief Elar was promoted to Lieu-tenant
in 1920. He took a Civil Service test 20 years later and became
head of the department after serving for a while as Acting Chief.
Although during a long career our top local lawman has done more
than his share of patient, undramatic law enforcement, the national
spotlight focused upon him at least twice in detective magazines.
The mysterious murder of Brooklyn sportsman William F Gilbride,
found lifeless in North Bellmore woods 40 years ago, was solved when
Elar discovered a man washing a car which had blood stains inside.
In the early &#x27;30s Elar was written up again in a national detective
magazine story about the police investigation of a sensational murder
case involving Sliding Billy Watson, a retired showman. The famous
entertainer was fatally shot by a waiter during an argument in a res-taurant
owned by Watson on West Merrick Road.
Police Chief Elar is active in the New York State Police Chiefs
Association^ having served nine years on the Board of Governors.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION
The Freeport Commission on Human Rights feels that you should
know about the New York State equal opportunity law.
This law tries to make sure that no person is denied his right to
apprenticeship, employment or advancement in employment; the pur-chase
or rental of housing, or the use of a place of public accommod-ation,
because of race, creed, color or national origin. In employ-ment,
the law protects the rights of older workers up to age 65 to
obtain jobs for which they are qualified.
Arthur Muller, chairman of the Commission, asks that any per-sons,
believing their rights have been violated, file complaints at
the Freeport Municipal Building, 46 North Ocean Avenue, care of
Village Clerk John J. Mac Donald.</dc:description>

per day. This fine can he imposed on the owner of the property, or
his agent or contractor, or on the tenant where the property is rented.
In addition, a violation of the Zoning Ordinance is &quot;disorderly
conduct,&quot; subject to police action.
Before any building may be erected, and before any structural
changes may be made on any building, a building permit must be ob-tained
from the Superintendent of Buildings, which gives the Super-intendent
a chance to examine the plans to make sure that the zoning
regulations are met. It is the Superintendent&#x27;s job to see to it that
zoning regulations are carried out. But since there are many thous-ands
of buildings in the Village, the Superintendent may be unaware
of the changed use of a building or even a structural change, unless
it is brought to his attention by someone.
T IT&#x27;S UP TO YOU
If you see construction or alteration work going on, and want to
kriow?whether-a-building permit has .been obtained, telephone the
Village Hall (Freeport 8-4000) and ask for the office of the Super-intendent
of Buildings. If the work or the changed use of a building
dp,esrnpt. conform to the zoning regulations and you^want-to find out - -
whether a variance or permit was obtained from the Board of Appeals,
ask for the office of the Superintendent of Buildings, as all such vari-ances
and permits must be filed in his office.
If you want help in seeing to it that the proper zoning is main-tained
in your neighborhood, consult your civic association.

Do you want to maintain the value of your property ? Then do

Property values go down when property becomes run-down. The

are only a few simple rules:
(1) See to it that the zoning regulations are .obeyed.
(2) Keep your own property looking attractive. Do.your bit, and
help set the standard for others.
(3) Make it clear to laggards in the neighborhood that their pro-perty
should be kept looking attractive.
For most residents the big question is, how may an owner of
land in the Residence &quot;A&quot; district use his property ? The uses all-owed
in Business &quot;B&quot; and other districts are described in the Zon-ing
Ordinance, which can be inspected in the office of the Village
Clerk.
RESIDENCE &quot;A&quot; DISTRICT
Since April 1, I960 only one-family houses are allowed in the
Residence &quot;A&quot; District. Before April, I960 two-family houses were
also allowed, and even three-family houses if permission was ob-tained
from the Board of Appeals. Houses which were legally occu-pied
as two-family or three-family residence on April 1, I960 may
legally continue as two and three-family residences respectively.
Apartment houses are not allowed in the Residence &quot;A&quot; District.
But churches are permitted, as well as public and private schools,
libraries, parks and hospitals. . . • . . ....
BOARDERS, ROOMERS AND LODGERS
No matter how big the house, not more than one room may be
rented out, and not more than two persons in all may occupy the one
rented room, unless a special permit has been obtained from the
Board of Appeals. But there are some special rules about rented
rooms:
(1) Roomers may not have separate cooking facilities.
(2) The roomers are not allowed to cook in the house.
(3) If it is a two-family house or larger, the roomers must
have a bathroom of their own, separate from the bathrooms of the
regular family apartments.
BUILDINGS
There must be at least 800 square feet of floor area in every dwel-ling
unless a special permit is obtained from the Board of Appeals.
There are special rules as to the size, height and locations of
buildings. For example, buildings may not be over three stories
high, and the lot must have at least 5, 000 square feet for each
familyc The home may not cover more than 30 per cent of the area
of the lot, and in addition not more than 10 per cent of the lot may
be covered by garages or other buildings. Front and rear yards
must each be at least 20 feet deep, and the rear yard must be at
least one-fifth of the whole depth of the lot, although it may contain
an accessory building such as a garage. Side yards must be at least
five feet wide on each side and the two side yards together must be
at least one-fourth of the whole width of the lot.
If the building on the lot is not a residence, or a building acces-sory
to a residence, it must have a side yard of at least 40 feet. ..
HOME OCCUPATIONS
Doctors, dentists aria other professional people may use their
homes as their offices. But for other home occupations a permit
must first be obtained from the Village Clerk and there are certain
rules which must be observed: the home occupation must be conduc-ted
in the residence, there may be no hired personnel, and the visi-ble
advertising is limited to certain types of signs (a six-inch by
12-inch professional name plate, or a one-foot by two-foot .sign not
more than four feet from the ground and at least 10 feet back from
the nearest property line).
CARS AND TRUCKS
Garage space or parking space may be provided on a lot for not
more than three automobiles. One of these automobiles may be a
truck, provided it does not have a capacity of more than one and one-half
ton -- but neither a truck nor a trailer may be stored outdoors.
The rules about renting out garage space ar,e stricter: garage
space for only one automobile may be rented out, but it must be a ^
passenger car, not a truck.
BOARD OF APPEALS
This Board is appointed by the Village Board. It has power to
grant a variance when the zoning ordinance is unfair or oppressive
as to a particular parcel of property, and it has power to grant spec-ial
permission to do certain things, but only after notice of the appli-cation
for the variance or permit is given to neighbors and a public
hearing is held at which people have a chance to explain any objec-tions
they may have. The Board of Appeals may exercise its power
to grant a permit only if it finds that it would not substantially dep-reciate
the value of other property, alter the essential character of
the neighborhood, or create a nuisance or fire hazard.
The decisions of the Board of Appeals are public records, and
mav be inspected in the office of the Village Clerk.
ENFORCING THE ZONING LAWS
The penalty for violating the Zoning Ordinance is a fine up to $100

BOARD ORGANIZATION MEETING (Continued from Page 1)
we are in a better position to discern the permanent realities of our
Village life -- and above all to recover that sense of unity as Free-porters
which underlies the discord and conflict of an election. It is
a fortunate fact that far more unites us than divides us.
&quot;It is in this spirit that this administration will act during the
next four years, with a unity of purpose, to achieve for our Village
the most efficient and economical operation of the Village without
sacrificing any of the services necessary for our effective existence.&#x27;
Among important business transacted was naming of department
heads, commissioners and citizen committee members.

CEREMONIES FOR MEMORIAL DAY (Continued from Page 1)
Music at the exercises will be furnished by the High School
Band. All veteran organizations and the Interfaith Clergy Council

Deputy; William Helland, Vice-Chair man; Frank Hall, Chief of
Staff, and Gary Ilgner, Adjutant.
Please display your American flag at half-mast until 12 noon on

PARADE AND CEREMONIES TO MARK MEMORIAL DAY
Memorial Day will be observed in the tradititonal manner with a
parade and .ceremonies, but a few changes will go into effect under
the leadership of Frank Manz, new Grand Marshal-Chair man. Mr.
Manz succeeds Samuel D. Gerber, who resigned after having served
as Grand Marshal for 32 years and was made Honorary Chairman.
This year, for the first time, Gold Star Mothers will ride to the
patriotic exercises on Village Green in autos specially provided for
them in the parade, which will start promptly at 10 A. M. from the
John W. Dodd Junior High School grounds. Because May 30 falls on a
Sunday, the parade will be Monday, May 31, over this route:
. E a s t on Little Pine Street to South Main Street, south on Main to
Merrick Road, west on Merrick Road to Long Beach Avenue, north
on Long Beach Avenue to Brooklyn Avenue, east on Brooklyn Avenue
to Ocean Avenue and north on Ocean Avenue to the Village Green.
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney will give the principal address. The
Rev. Joakim Valasiadis of St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church is
scheduled to deliver the Invocation and the Rev. H. Edgar Thoren of
the First Baptist Church the Benediction.

VILLAGE BOARD HAS ORGANIZATION MEETING
Mayor Robert J. Sweeney, Trustee Henry M. Altengarten, Trus-tee
Frank W. Somers and Police Justice Edwin J. Freedman -- given
a vote of confidence in the March elections -- started their second
tern-is at the annual organization meeting April 5.
After the Invocation was delivered by the Rev. A. Edward Couch
of the First Presbyterian Church, County Judge Paul Kelly of Free-port
administered the oath of office.
The Mayor spoke as follows, in part:
&quot;Now that the dust of the recent campaign has begun to settle,
(Continued on Page 4)
THE METER DEPARTMENT
Robert N. Kinsey Sr. is so closely associated with the Village
meters that some Freeporters may doubt that they ever existed with-out
him. Actually the Meter Department was established in 1949 under
the direction of Comptroller (and later Village Clerk) Milford Van
Riper -- two years before Mr. Kinsey, now Superintendent, became
Foreman. Roy Lewis was the first Foreman.
Parking meters were orignally put into use in 1949. Water meters
were inststalled and maintained before the automobile caused a boom
in parking meters. But soon it became evident that cars lining South
Main Street, Merrick Road, Grove Street, Church Street and West
Sunrise Highway had grown so numerous that penny and nickel meters
were needed.
At first Mr. Kinsey handled only water meters, starting in 1951.
He was Foreman, with one assistant. His work&#x27;sooh expanded to in-clude
parking meters. In those days, -as now .--he-kept, in close..touch
with the Village Clerk&#x27;s office.
There are 840 metered spaces on the streets -- served by 361
double and 118 single meters operated by pennies or nickels. Seven
parking fields contain a total of 384 spaces metered to take nickels,
dimes or quarters, while two fields -- those on Church Street and the
west side of Henry Street -- also accommodate drivers who deposit
special tokens.
With the aid of Louis Primavera who has served for the past two
years, Mr. Kinsey has a t-wo -fold responsibility: to collect from the
meters, and to repair them. Sometimes repairing can be done on the
spot, while at other times it is necessary to substitute another meter
for the broken one.
On most days the job begins as early as 6:30 A. M. Street meters
are serviced four times a week. Coins are in sealed containers in-side
the meters when collected. Parking fields get daily attention.
The work 7rows much more difficult on winter&#x27;s snowy, windy days,
but despite extra hardships the members of the department have never
missed making a collection. They also paint all meter poles-once a
year.
Many parking fields are free, except in the very heart of town.
In a field on the east side of Ocean Avenue, north of Our Holy Redee-mer
Church&#x27;s property, 60 spaces formerly metered have been con-verted
to free use. This had been a commuters&#x27; car haven when the
old Long Island Railroad station stood just east of Grove Street.
Mr. Kinsey originally joined the Village family in the 1940&#x27;s as a
Power Plant electrician&#x27;s helper. Transferring to Republic Aviation,
he became a checker in the final assembly line, inspecting planes
before test pilots took the aircraft up on trial flights. His mechanical
experience there led him to enter the meter department upon his re-turn
to Village employment. Mr. Kinsey, an ex-Fire Cheif, has been
a Freeport Fireman for 31 years. (Continued on Page 4)

1967 — OUR DIAMOND JUBILEE YEAR
While 1967 may seem a long way off, it&#x27;s near enough to merit
some consideration of how Freeport organizations intend to celebrate
the Village&#x27;s 75th (Diamond) Jubilee.
There has been talk of observances starting early in the year, ris-ing
to a climax by October, the month Freeport was born in 1892.
Let&#x27;s find ways to mark this significant anniversary. It Will give
everyone -- children, oldsters and residents of all ages -- better
community spirit if we focus attention upon what we owe to the early
settlers. A Jubilee Planning Committee will be formed soon. Its
members will welcome any suggestions you may have.

DON&#x27;T PUT GRASS CLIPPINGS IN THE GUTTER
Some residents have caused trouble with road drains by placing
loose grass clippings alongside the curb or roadside in front of
their homes -- possibly because of a mistaken belief that a leaf- .
pickup truck would take it away. Such is not the case. Clipped
blades of grass just lie there, until carried down the street by
flowing rain water , and eventually block highway drains.
Superintendent of Highways Harry J. Chuisano, whose drainage
crew is handicapped by this ill-advised practice, suggests:
&quot;Place grass in bushel baskets or cardboard boxes and leave
them at the curb so that Sanitation Department employees can col-lect
the grass when they pick up trash. &quot; John S. Marra, Superin-tendent
of Sanitation, added that trash is picked up on Wednesdays
except during holiday weeks.
FREEPORT GOVERNMENT ABC&#x27;s
Freeport, an incorporated village, is governed by a Mayor and
four Trustees. Half of -the Trustees are elected to four-year terms
each two years, while the Mayor also has a four-year term of office.
Village Board&#x27;meetings open to the public take place at 9 P.M. on
the first and third Monday of each month -- except in June, July,
August and September, when open meetings are the first Monday.
Although incorporated, Freeportis still part of the town and county
in some governmental matters. Real estate property owners pay
town, county and school district taxes, participating also in the elec-tion
of officials to administer those areas. But the Village must reg-ulate
its own property as well as handle many functions of vital im-portance
locally. Through its officials Freeport enacts ordinances,
levies taxes, issues licenses, and records some vital statistics.
In addition to department heads, there are boards .and committees
appointed by the Mayor and Trustees. (Continued on Page 2)
FREEPQRT GOVERNMENT ABC&#x27;s (Continued from Page 1)
Village Clerk : . •* v &quot; :
The Clerk is appointed for two years as a full-time official charg-ed
with the over-all responsibility of keeping Village Affairs in run-ning
order, A staff of typists, stenographers, clerks and record-keepers,
as well as two deputies, help him in this day-to-day work.
Local elections are under his supervision.
Treasurer I ••.-.-•
Named for a two-year term, the Treasurer.is responsible for
.prepartation and collection of taxes and fees. He also pays author-ized
bills. All accounting and fiscal matters are his responsibility.
A full-time official, Freeport&#x27;s Treasurer is also Village Assessor.
Budget
The Mayor and Trustees, in close collaboration with the Treas-urer,
prepare the proposed annual budget. There is a public hear-ing;
on the budget, notices of which must appear in theofficial news-paper
and be posted in not less than five conspicuous places, includ-ing
the Village Hall bulletin board. - -
Planning and Zoning Board
All decisions of the five-member Planning Board must be approv-ed
or revised by the Trustees before they can go into effect. The
five-man Zoning Board of Appeals, also comprising five appointive
members, has greater independent authority. If a citizen wishes to
erect or change a structure which would not conform to the building
code or zoning ordinances, the Superintendent of Buildings must
deny his application for a building permit. The case may then be
heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals, which under some conditions
can allow a variance.
Services
Freeport operates a municipal electricity plant and distribution
system, a complete water supply plant and a sewage disposal
system. ~ -
The Highway Department maintains all Village streets. It also
has the responsibility for snow removal, paving, storm drains and
street cleaning.
Parks, the Stadium and a Youth Center are run by the Park De-partment.
The Sanitation Department make garbage, refuse and trash col-lections
in addition to providing for disposal in an incinerator.
Freeport has its own Police Department. A Police Justice, elec-ted
for four years, handles traffic violations, ordinance violations,
disorderly conduct, drunkenness, noise and dog complaints and
speeding on local waterways.
The Fire Department&#x27;s efficiency, plus modern and well-kept
equipment, with a dependable water supply, earns Freeport a very
low fire insurance rate.
WAR ON LEAVES MAPPED IN ADVANCE
Freeport has outlined its strategy for a war on leaves, to be waged
in the autumn. Two additional leaf-pickers (operating like vacuum
cleaners) are^ being purchased to draw up the leaves. This will in-crease
to four&#x27;the number of such specially equipped trailers avail-able
for use by the Highway Department,,
A novelty due on our streets next Fall will be six metal containers
ordered by the Village Board. These, fitted neatly onto truck bodies,
will speed up the disposal of leaves gathered by the &quot;vacuum clean-ers.&quot;
IMPORTANT NOTE; The leaf-pickers will not start their rounds
until sometime in October or November, on a date to be announced.

FOR A CLEANER FREEPQRT
Among the many groups helping to make our community better,
a most useful new one is the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Committee to Keep Free-port
Clean.&quot; Representatives from leading organizations met .on
June 17 in the Memorial Library to lay the groundwork for a pro-gram.
It was decided that educating the public in cleanliness
through local publications would be a major effort, along with other
activities.
This project, sparked by the Exchange Club and its president,
William Vogt, was launched through invitations signed by Mr. Vogt
and two members of the Village Beautification Committee -- Char-lotte
Tessier and Leo Young.
As a starter the organizers suggested five keys to a clean com-munity:
(1) Use litter containers; (2) Put all garbage inside proper-ly
covered cans, (3) Keep trash out of vacant lots, (4) Place side-walk
and gutter sweepings in trash cans and (6) Curb your dog.</dc:description>

day.
Weekly trash collection will resume the following Wednesday, Sept.
15, throughout the village.
Mrs. John Tessier, chairman of the Freeport Beautification Com-mittee,
reports that some residents are leaving their trash at the
curb for prolonged periods before Wednesday pickups. Besides vio-lating
village regulations which provide &quot;no material shall be placed
at the curb area. . .before 6 p. m. on the day prior to collection, &quot;
this practice contributes to unsightly neighborhood conditions, ac-cording
to the committe.

NEW FREEPORT POLICE CHIEF
Captain Edward S. Dixon, a 37-year veteran of the village police
department, has been appointed chief by the village board. He re-placed
Chief Peter Elar&#x27;who retired Aug. 1 after reaching the man-datory
retirement age of 70.
A member of the force for 48 years, Chief Elar became its rank-ing
officer in 1940. He guided the department&#x27;s expansion from a
40 -man unit of the pre-war days through the community&#x27;s growth
period of the fifties, and into the present operation of 61 men, in-cluding
a detective division and the heralded K-9 corps.
The new chief, at 65, is also a veteran law enforcement specialist.
He joined the department in 1928 and rose through the ranks to be-come
Chief Elar&#x27;s heir apparent several years ago. As the depart-ment&#x27;s
second ranking&#x27;officer; he acquired valuable administrative
experience by assuming controlvof the village force during Chief
Elar&#x27;s absences -- for vacations and illnesses -- in recent years.
Chisf Dixon is highly regarded in the many local and state police
organizations with which he is actively associated. In recent years,
in additipn to many other duties, he s&#x27;erved as village safety officer
and commander of the K-9 corps, a unit he was instrumental in or-ganizing.
Chief Dixon, who has publicly announced that no major changes
in department policies or functions are contemplated in the near
future, is also active in Boy Scout work and as a hunting safety in-structor
for the State Conservation Department. He lives at 119 East
Dean St. , with his wife, Vera.
Retiring Cheif Elar became a policeman for the first time in 1916,
a lieutenant in 1920, rose to captain in 1940 and later that same year
was installed as chief. ( See pix - Page 4)
RECREATION LEADER
Richard Hanak of 352 St. Marks Ave. has been named by the vil-lage
board to replace Walter Richardson as recreation superinten-dent.
A resident of Freeport for three years, he came to work for
the village as assistant recreation superintendent on July 14, 1964,
from a position with the Boys Club of New York. The 29-year-old
New York University graduate reports that recreation activity for
the first half of this year indicates that last year&#x27;s record total of
128,939 participants will be surpassed.

NO LIQUOR SHOPS IN MARINE INDUSTRY ZONES
It has been decided by the village board that package liquor stores
do not properly belong in marine industry zones. The decision fol-lows
a. public hearing on a requested change in the zoning regulations
that was opposed by the Atlantic South Civic Association, the Harbor
Civic Association and the Chamber of Commerce.
In its ruling, the board cited the intent of the marine industry zon-ing
classification -- To permit businesses compatible with waterfront
commerce.
* * *
WATER SURVEY
In its constant effort to maintain adequate water pressure through-out
the village and to guide future installations, the Board of Water
and Light Commissioners has initiated a comprehensive study of the
water distribution system. The survey, to be conducted by the vil-lage
engineer, has been approved by the village board.
* * *
WAIVE ZONING FEE
Applications for zoning variances involving properties included in
the widening of Atlantic Avenue will be processed without the usual
filing charges, the village board announced. The usual fee is $25
for residential and $50 for business applications.

Sewer and Sanitation Commission
First organized on April 11, 1923, the Board of Sewer Commis-sioners,
as it was then known, did not erect its first physical facil-ity
until 1927, when a trunk sewer was established from northwest
Freeport to the pumping station on Ray Street. Prior to this time,
cesspools and septic tanks prevailed.
It wasn&#x27;t until 39 years later, at the annual village board meeting
on April 2, 1962, that the present Municipal Board of Sewer and San-itation
Commissioners was officially created.
The agency now meets twice monthly to act as a laison between tax-payers
and the village board in all matters relating to the sanitation
system, sewers, the incinerator, the sewage disposal plant and the
village garage. The sessions are held on the first and third Thurs-days
at 8 p. m.
Currently serving on the commission are Gustav J. Berkel, chair-man,
Fabian Adler, Loren Hebl, John Augustine and John Daly. In
attendance at all gatherings of the commission to provide technical
data and guidance are: Daniel McNamara Jr. , counsel; Walter Pope,
village engineer; John Marra, superintendent of sanitation operations;
and Edward McKeeman, sewer department superintendent.
Among the many responsibilities charged to the commission is the
control of industrial wastes into the sewer system. The discharge of
such materials can overtax existing facilities, and therefore, this
source is under constant and careful scrutiny and limitation.
Homeowners do not normally come in contact with the commission
unless violations of existing codes occur. Garbage collection and sew
age disposal are routine services which the average family tends to
take for granted, and until a disruption of service develops the com-mission&#x27;s
behine-the-scenes efficiency is seldom noticed.

APPOINTMENTS
Anthony Celentano, a 42-year-old general contractor who lives at
329 Archer St. , was selected by the village board to fill a vacancy
on the park commission created by the resignation of Salvatore F.
Cataldo.
Francis Ceravolo, an attorney who practices in Freeport, was
named to the Citizens Committee on Community Planning. A vice
president of the Atlantic South Civic Association, he lives at; 143
Fair view Place with his wife and two children.

FOR CLEAN WATERWAYS
Vitally interested in guarding one of our most precious natural
resources, the village board has authorized Superintentent of Sewer
Operations Edward McKeeman to attend a special meeting on water
pollution control called by the federal authorities. It will be held
in Atlantic City in October. Members of the Board of Sewer and Sanit-ation
Commissioners will also attend.
ZONE CHANGE
After a public hearing last month, the village board voted to follow
the recommendation of the planning board in rezoning from Residence-A
to Residence-Apartment the easterly side of South Long Beach Avenue
between Pine Street and Sunrise Highway. This change was suggested by
the consultants who developed a master plan for the village. It brings
the half-block sector into comformity with the surrounding properties.
Only garden type apartment buildings, not more than two and one-half
stories high, are permitted under the zoning ordinances.
HOLIDAY GARBAGE PLAN
Observation of the traditional Columbus Day holiday by all village
agencies will mean a revision of sanitation department collections for
the week of Oct. 11. Garbage will be picked up from the areas north of
Merrick Road on the regular days— Monday and Thursday, but southern
collections must be changed to Wednesday and Friday because of the day
off on Tuesday, Oct. 12.
Superintendent John S. Marra announced that the regular Wednesday
rubbish collection will not be made on Oct. 13. It will be resumed the
following week. He also repeated an appeal to residents not to place
materials for the Wednesday refuse runs at the curb before 6 p. m. on
Tuesdays because of the unsightly conditions created by prolonged dis-plays
of trash in ordinarily attractive residential neighborhoods. The
Village Beautification Committee is currently engaged in a drive to
stamp out this detrimental practice which is a violation of local
ordinances.

RENEWAL STUDY CONTINUES
The preliminary urban renewal study period, scheduled to expire last
month, has been extended by federal and state authorities to February,
1966. In making the announcement, Mayor Robert J. Sweeney again
stressed that Freeport is in no way committed to go into a renewal
program. &quot;The additional time,&quot; he said, &quot;will allow us to bring to
the public complete information on the pros and cons, before a final
decision is made.&quot; Under urban renewal, a local municipality can
rehabilitate substandard structures, or even whole neighborhoods, at a
fraction of the cost— as little as one-eighth is possible— because
of financial assistance available from federal and state sources.
Mayor Sweeney pointed out that despite the provision of government
funds for the lengthy and comprehensive studies being conducted in
the village by professional experts, the village board may still de-cline
to undertake a slum clearance project. It is hoped, he stated,
that many of the details of the program being proposed will be ready
for general release within a few weeks.
TWO BOARD SESSIONS IN OCTOBER
Public meetings of the Village Board of Trustees will be resumed on
the regular schedule of the first and third Mondays of each month be-ginning
in October. During the summer months, only one public meeting
is held each month though the board members meet in executive session
weekly throughout the year. Public meetings are not scheduled on hol-idays
or on the eve of holidays* All residents are cordially invited
to attend the public board meetings which are held at the Municipal
Building, 46 North Ocean Ave., at 9 p. m.
METER MAIDS
A resolution establishing the position of parking meter attendant
or &quot;parking control officer, female&quot; has been passed by the village
board. The move is aimed at freeing policemen from meter supervision
and control for more active police work. It has not been decided when
the meter maids will be hired.
LITTER CONTAINERS
The Chamber of Commerce is purchasing ten litter baskets for the
central business area and -the village board has-agreed to put signs on
them calling attention to regulations which make littering punishable
bv a fine.
CIVIC HONORS
Taylor Hall, president of the Freeport Block Association for
Neighborhood Improvement, has been cited for his leadership in main-taining
neighborhood standards. A member of the village&#x27;s planning
board, he is an attendance consultant in Queens schools. He was given
the annual achievement award of the association, an organization
formed to encourage residents of the northeast section to clear up un-sightly
and substandard conditions in the area and to keep streets and
lots clean.
ABOUT YOUR MONEY
Don&#x27;t let that new figure on your electric bill confuse you. It
represents the two per cent state sales tax that recently went into
effect. Village treasurer Leonard D. B. Smith and his staff have been
answering a flood of questions on the additional charge by explaining
that the tax applies to public utility services so it must be levied
against all customers of the village electric department. The treas-urer&#x27;s
office has also been burdened in recent weeks with checks and
money orders not accompanied by bill -stubs or any other clue as to
their intended purpose. In an effort to avoid wasteful clerical hand-ling,
Mr. Smith requests that when paying electric, water or other
municipal bills, please take care to enclose the bill stub or sotr.e
notation.

FIRE PREVENTION AND PROTECTION
Jim Me Bride, a member of the Freeport Volunteer Fire Department&#x27;s
public relations committee, displays some of the equipment he uses in
talks on fire safety. Speakers who demonstrate and discuss the latest
in fire safety techiniques and apparatus are available to any group of
10 persons or more in the community. The department recently estab-lished
this civic service in an effort to educate as many individuals
as possible on the importance of guarding against fires and the proper
procedures to follow when a fire occurs.
APPOINTMENTS
Charles H. Whitty, superintendent of electrical distribution, has
been appointed safety officer of the village, a position he-Id by Police
Chief Edward S. Dixon before he assumed command of the police force.
The safety officer keeps posted on all village operations and makes
recommendations for accident prevention.
Leo Young of 148 Maxson Ave., has been named to the Citizens
Committee on Comunity Planning for a term that expires in April 1966.
An importer of food products, he has offices in Freeport. He is also
active with the Citizens Committee to Keep Freeport Clean, the Chamber
of Commerce and the Exchange Club.

Leonard D.B» Smith, preeport&#x27;s vil1 age-Treasurer, has
received high praise for his activities in the State
Conference of Mayors and Other Municipal Officials.
James J. DeJohn, president of the organization, sin-gled
out Mr. Smith for his work on the group&#x27;s legis-lative
committee which screened more than 2,000 bills
affecting village government that were submitted to
the state legislature&#x27;s last session. The citation
said, &quot;Your community can be proud of the service you
rendered to the cause of good local government. With-out
your generous giving of time and effort we should
not have been able to accomplish what we did.&quot;
Vacant Lot Eyesores
Complaints have come from several sources in recent
weeks about unsightly conditions in some vacant lots
scattered throughout the village. These are covered
with ugly weeds and have an accumulation of rubbish.
It is the responsibil ity..of the property owner to
maintain the lot in a neat and sanitary condition.
The ordinance (No. 5.5, Section 2) is clear and to
the point: &quot;No person shall place or permit to re-main
in any courtyard, vacant lot, open space, cellar,
hallway or alley, an accumulation of waste paper,
saw-dust, hay, grass, straw, weeds, litter, boxes,
barrels, or cartons, or any combustible flammable
waste or rubbish of any kind.&quot;
Coming Soon; Our Diamond Jubilee
Village authorities, old timers and history buffs
will soon begin gathering ideas for the&quot;&#x27;Freeport
Diamond Jubilee celebration which is only about a

Autumn Leaves And What To Do About Them
The colorful autumn leaves are a delight to all,
•while they are displaying their many hues from
the branches of lofty trees. But when they fall
gracefully to the ground the accumulation can be
troublesome unless they are quickly gathered up
and transported to the disposal plant.
A very large outdoor vacuum cleaner can be very
helpful, and as a matter of fact the village&#x27;s
highway department has just such a piece of
equipment. It is known as a scavenger truck and
it will be vacuuming leaves for you throughout
the &quot;season. Highway Superintendent Harry Chuisano
will need your cooperation, however, if the large
scale vacuuming operation is to be done most
effectively.
Please rake leaves neatly along the curb line of
your property, and please be sure there are no
branches or other objects which would hamper the
vacuum truck. It will be operating in your area
on alternate weeks — north of Sunrise Highway
one week and south of the highway the following
week.
You need not rely entirely upon the scavenger
truck to dispose of the leaves around your prop-erty.
Superintendent--of--Sanitation John Marra
will have two trucks in use.during the same
period to pick up leaves left In baskets or other
containers for Wednesday morning pickup. The
sanitation men will take the leaves and leave the
container .for your re-use. Please do not put con-tainers
at the curb until after 6:00 p m Tuesday
night. Please keep in mind, too, the exceptional
Wednesdays — there is no trash pickup on the
Wednesday of any week that contains a holiday.

John J. MacDonald
A Key Man: The Village Clerk
They come in a steady stream
to the village clerk&#x27;s office
-- residents with complaints,
builders seeking permits^
tradesmen needing licenses,
persons with claims against
the village, candidates with
queries on election procedures.
The present village clerk,
John J. MacDonald, likes all
this activity and the heavy
responsibility that goes with
being the chief administrative officer of the village
He considers it an honor to be the &quot;ambassador&quot; of
the village board in its dealings with the public.
Mr. MacDonald came to the clerk&#x27;s office in 1956,
was appointed a deputy in 1958 and elevated to
village clerk April, 1961. He had previously been
in the manufacturing department of a Garden City
publishing firm for many years.
He has found in his nine years of village service
that the clerk&#x27;s office is &quot;the nerve center of
Freeport&#x27;s government.&quot; In seeking information or
registering grievances people do not usually know
exactly where to go, his experience has shown, so
they turn to the village clerk, who is a full-time
department head.
In Mr. MacDonald they find a sympathetic ear. It
is his policy not to transfer their calls, he said.
&quot;I don&#x27;t like to buck calls along. I know how that
feels, so I listen to the full story and see that
the proper department head is contacted personally,&quot;
he explained.
Foremost among the village, clerk&#x27;s, duties, is, this
handling of citizens who have business at village
hall. But it is only a small part of the workload
of a staff that includes several deputies, typists,
stenographers and other office assistants.
Licenses are issued under the supervision of the
second deputy clerk to plumbers, electricians,

The efficiency of the village clerk is reflected in
the ledger where police reports on damage or failure
of village facilities — traffic lights, signs, hy-drants
or roads -- are first recorded. Such items
remain in the ledger until cancelled by a completion
notice from the village department responsible for
correction of the condition.
The village clerk is custodian of all village records
and documents, including the minute books of meetings
held by the municipality&#x27;s boards and commissions.
Births and deaths in Freeport are recorded and burial
permits are issued through the second deputy clerk,
who is the registrar of vital statistics.
Mr. MacDonald lives at 291 Smith Street with his
wife, Helen. His daughter is a sophomore at New Paltz
State Teachers College. Active as a volunteer fireman
for more than 40 years, he has held several offices
in the Freeport Fire Department. His favorite leisure
pursuit is the reading of biographies, particularly
on Shelter Island, a retreat he has come to cherish
since &quot;discovering&quot; it eight years ago.
A New Face For Main Street
The Main Street business area from Sunrise Highway
to Merrick Road gets a bright new face — complete
repaving, replacement of curbs to the proper level
and brand new sidewalks -- by virtue of coordinated
programs of the village and Nassau County (Main
Street is a county road).
For some time the businessmen along the street have
been asking the village to initiate such a public
improvement. When the county public works department
announced it would arrange for repaving of tw.o street
and replacement of curbs, the Village Board acted to
tie in the installation of new sidewalks in front of
all stores. Ninety-five percent of the cost of the
sidewalk improvement will be paid, on a five-year
assessment, by the property owners along the street,
with the other five percent borne by the village.</dc:description>

Decision Nearer On Urban Renewal
November, 1965
The Newark consultant firm of Candeub, Fleissig,
Adley and Associates has been hired for planning
of the proposed first urban renewal project area.
All planning costs in these first stages are
being paid by the federal government.
If approved by Freeport voters in a public refer-endum,
about two years hence, the first project
would include the property lying between Merrick
and Mill Roads from Henry Street east, and the
central business district bounded by Broadway,
South Grove, Smith and Henry Streets.
Overall cost of the first project has- been roughly
estimated at between 12 and 13 million dollars,
three-fourths of which would be paid out of feder-al
funds. The balance would be split between the
state and the village. Part of the village&#x27;s share
could be made up of non-cash contributions, inclu-ding
public improvements now existing or made
before the start of the project.
Urban renewal planning in Freeport has advanced
through the first two phases — creation of a
master plan which establishes guidelines for the
entire village, and of a general neighborhood re-newal
plan which has studied all of the areas which
might be included in renewal projects.
A citizens&#x27; committee follows the progress of plan-ning,
meeting periodically with Urban Renewal Di-rector
Stanley Roth and members of the village
Planning Board. Chairman is Roy Cacciatore, and
its members are drawn from many civic and service
groups. Organization representatives are urged to
report frequently to their own group&#x27;s members on
all matters discussed by the committee, so that
every interested person may make an intelligent
appraisal before the referendum.

Finance Chief - The Village Treasurer
The Village of Freeport,
which operates in many ways
like a major corporation,
has had an official treasurer
since it began in 1892. Today
the Job is much more complex
because it involves handling
or disbursing more than $6
million annually. Also, the
village treasurer is asses-sor,
budget officer and
financial advisor to the
Board of Trustees. Leonard D.B. Smith
In Leonard D.B. Smith Freeport has a recognized
authority in the municipal fiscal field. His com-petence
is reflected in statistics which show that
the treasurer&#x27;s department has been reduced from
43 to 26 employees since Mr. Smith took over in
1955. This economy was realized by utilization of
IBM equipment, staff training and modernization
of procedures.
Further testimony to the respect he commands in
his field was his recent election as president of
the State Finance Officers Association. His state-wide
reputation was earned as past president and
executive secretary of the Municipal Electric Util-ities
Association and former director of the State
Assessors Association.
A battery of ledgers recording receipts and expen-ditures
is maintained for an annual budget in ex-cess
of $3 million, electricity payments of $2.5
million and water revenues of about $500,000. The
village treasurer must also sell capital notes,
make deposits, collect all village taxes, hold tax
sales, issue tax certificates, auction real estate
brought to his Jurisdiction through foreclosures,
and file a variety of reports with county, state
and federal authorities.
Mr. Smith assumed the duties of treasurer after a
solid background that included nine years as a
Village Trustee (1946-1955) and more than 30 years
in banking. He lives at 20 Randall Avenue with his
wife. Catherine, and is the father of three sons.</dc:description>

Superintendent of Electric Utilities Ludovic Long

the Freeport municipal plant restores power to

Know Your Village
We Fared We 1 1 in Blackout
Assessing the effects on the village of the gigan-tic
power failure of November 9, Mayor Sweeney
found that Freeport was in better shape than most
other communities to meet the emergency. &quot;All
village personnel involved were working as a
smoothly functioning team,&quot; he said, &quot;and residents
were
sant
calm and helpful
situation,&quot;
to each other in the unplea-
Our plant was temporarily knocked out of service
because it does not produce all of the electricity
we need and is therefore interconnected with the-public
utility. Normally we produce about 60% of
the more than 21,000 kilowatts used at peak periods,
Within the past two years electrical production has
tripled, due to installation of new generating
equipment and other improvements.
Many hours before power was restored generally to
Long Island, Freeporters had electricity. A freak-ish
failure of the circuit breakers to re-close
automatically, one of the many technical puzzles in
the overall blackout, prevented our plant from get-ting
back into service even sooner. As generators
were re-started the municipal plant fed first one
section of town then another, so that chilled homes
would be given some warmth as early as possible.
All fire companies were manned and on the alert.
The large floodlight truck stood by to provide
emergency generating power wherever it might be
needed. There was no breakdown of the fire alarm
system because it has the safeguard of emergency
battery power. Auxiliary pumps to assure adequate
water pressure were manned, as a precaution, by
Superintendent Crevoiserat&#x27;s men, but they were not
needed. The approximately 100 men of our civil
defense unit were on stand-by, and their communica-tions
people set up a patrol of mobile radios.
Except for two false alarms and a broken store win-dow
there were no incidents in the relatively brief
period it took our electric department to get our
al1-important power source functioning once again.
Moving Forward Electrically
At a public meeting on November 15, Mayor Sweeney
announced, with the unanimous agreement of the
Board of Trustees, that the v i l l a g e now intends to
move for 100% independent electrical production.
Recent engineering studies, he said, indicate the
village may be able to economically build a new9
larger generating station able to handle the en-tire
peak load requirements. The report has been
given to the village&#x27;s Board of Water and Light
Commissioners, for its study and recommendationsa
&quot;We know a new plant producing 100% of our elec-tricity
will result in lower rates for all Freeport
consumers,&quot; the mayor said. &quot;Our own completely
independent plant would be a source of pride and a
great asset of the incorporated village, in which
all Freeporters are stockholders.&quot;
It is hoped that a new plant would be able to gener-ate
about 45,000 kilowatts, as compared with present
capacity of about 13,000. Financing would be by means
of long term bond issue (perhaps 30 or 40 years), to
be paid out of funds derived from electricity sales,,

More Recognition For .Freeport
Two articles by Village Historian Clinton E. Mete were
published in the November issue of the magazine for
municipal officers and employees, The American City,
with national distribution.
They highlighted recent improvements
power plant, electrical distribution
lighting system,,
in the municipal
and the street
Mr. Metz pointed out that the village recently comple-ted
a 100^ changeover in street lighting, converting
2,150 filament lamps to modern mercury vapor units.
After the lighting improvement accident figures dropped
by Z5% and robberies by 64^c
The mercury units burn about six times longer than the
old filament lamps, and they produce about three times
as many lumens per watt. They replaced fixtures that in
some cases had been in service&quot;for 30 years.&#x27; - &#x27;-•&quot;- —-
Freeport has more than 100 miles of streets in an area
just under five square miles. Spacing of-.the new light-ing
standards in the business area averages 1.25 feet.
In the residential sections the spacing ranges from.
200 to 300 feet. Mounting heights average about 25 feet
including the overhanging brackets.
The Freeport municipal system of electrical production
and distribution serves about 12,000 residential and
1,435 commercial accounts. Last summer the system peaked
at 21,750 kilowatts. The winter peak was 21,100.

Tjpzoning
After a public hearing on November 29 the Village Board
of Trustees voted to rezone a one-square block area in
south Freeport from Residence-apartment to Residence-A.
As a result, only one-family homes will now be permitted
as new construction in the block bounded by Front Street
and Cedar Street, between South Ocean and Miller Aven-ues.
The zoning change was recommended in the recently com-pleted
master plan studies, to bring that area into
conformity with the surrounding residential area. It
was approved by the Planning Board and endorsed by the
Atlantic South Civic Association, the Southwest Civic
Association and 70O petitioners in the neighborhood.
The block presently contains the Leo F. Giblyn elemen-tary
school, a small development of garden apartments
..and several private homes. i

Commendation - »&#x27; J
The Village Board, in executive session, voted unani-mously
to commend the work of the Sewer Department,
under Superintendent :£dwin McKeeman, during the massive
blackout in November, in .addition to the other depart-ments
already named.
&quot;Mr. McKeemah&#x27;s able crews demonstrated their readi-ness,,
to &#x27;swing, into action promptly In an emergency,&quot;
said Mayor&#x27;Sweeney, &quot;to prevent any breakdown in our
sanitary conditions.&quot;
The board noted that the village is fortunate in
having employees who will respond willingly to a call
for action beyond their regular duties.

Superintendent of
Sanitation, John Marra
A few short months ago
Superintendent Marra
started doing something
new about a persistent
problem. He began dis-tributing
polite written
reminders to the many
home-owners who were for-getting
that there is no
curbside trash pick-up on
the Wednesday of any week
that contains a holiday -
so that unsightly rubbish
would not be left out for
days. From a high poiTit of
about 800 such homes the
number was reduced to only
158 for the Thanksgiving
holiday week, and Mr. Marra
hopes we will soon arrive
at the time when noone will
need to be reminded about
&quot;exceptional Wednesdays.&quot;

The Sanitation Department is
divided into four separate
units: (1) collection (2)
incinerator (3) land-fill
and (4) garage. It is under
the jurisdiction of the Sewer
and Sanitation Commission.
In the residential collection
there are more than 8700
homes, serviced twice weekly
for garbage pick-up and once
for rubbish. On the commercial
routes, which include apart-ment
houses, there

Residents may dispose of
trash at the land-fill area
by depositing it there any

The village Board has imposed new stricter require-ments
for hawkers and peddlers, after a public hearing

Hawkers and peddlers are no longer permitted to park
in any street that contains metered parking zones.
The vehicles can stand in other streets for not more
than ten

H special meeting of the Freeport Civil Defense organ-ization
was held in January, with a representative of
the controlling county unit. Colonel Jerome L. Lowen-berg,
Deputy to General Joseph A. Bulger, the Nassau
County Director.
One of the purposes of the meeting was to clarify the
role of the Freeport Civil Defense group in a natural
disaster, such as the massive power failure in November
Under those circumstances, Colonel Lowenberg reported,
the executive head of the municipality, the mayor, is
in complete charge of the local situation. Village
Trustee Frank Somers is serving as Acting Civil Defense
Director of the village.
The New Budget
After a public hearing on January 10,.an annual budget
of $3,476,985.98 was adopted by the Board of Trustees.
L/
An increase of $409,239.94 over last year is partially
offset by higher revenue from additional taxable prop-erty
and other sources, so that the net increase is
actually $286,439.94. Total estimated revenues of
$1,062,000 are applied against the budget figure,
which leaves $2,414,985.98 to be raised by real estate
taxes. The basis for computing the tax rate is the
assessed valuation of all property in the village,
which at $83,853,680 is about $1,000,000 more than
last year.
The new tax rate is $2.88 per hundred dollars of
assessed valuation, up 31«f from last year. &quot;After
holding—the-tax line-to-a—total increase of only Qt!
for the last three years,&quot; Mayor Sweeney reported,
&quot;we were finally forced to an unavoidably higher cost
of providing the necessary village services.&quot;
The bulk of the tax increase is in two areas, the
mayor noted- personnel services and payments for long-term
capital improvements. New personnel include five
more men for the Sanitation Department and a new shift
of four men for the incinerator; two more policemen,
plus two meter maids to release men for other active
police duty; another Building Inspector for stronger
enforcement of the building codes; an assistant to the
Village Attorney to help cope with the increasingly
complex legal aspects of governing the village.

Board Rejects Beach Proposal
A suggestion that the village purchase the small
former private beach area known as Beau Rivage and
renovate it for a municipal beach was Judged imprac-tical
by the Board of Trustees. The unanimous decision
was made after a report by the Park Commission, a study
of water quality and a survey of residents&#x27; reaction
in the immediate vicinity.
Although the most recent county report showed the water
satisfactory for swimming, the Park Commission found
that the small beach area and facilities would accom-odate
less than one percent of Freeport&#x27;s population
&quot;at any given time. The-cost of purchase and yearly
operation would of course have had to be borne by all
village taxpayers.
Another factor is the extremely limited off-street
parking facilities, the commission report noted, and
nearby residents would be subject to many nuisances,
including traffic bottlenecks and parking problems.
It was estimated that the cost of acquiring the land
and erecting a suitable building would be about
$115,000. Personnel and maintenance costs were estim-ated
at $22,000 each year, plus about $5,000 yearly
for replacement of sand which is rapidly eroded in
that location.

Freeport Volunteers~Are~Movie&#x27;Stars
Our village is sponsoring a large scale blood
drive for United States servicemen wounded in
Viet Nam.
The Mayor and Village Board of Trustees launched
the campaign in response to a suggestion by Free-porters
who wanted their community to indicate in
some specific way its support of our men in ser-vice.
A movie short subject, &quot;Ladders Up&quot;, features the
Freeport Volunteer Fire Department. Filmed in our
village, it is being shown in Long Island theatres
and is slated for national distribution. Millions
of people across the country will get a view of
our community and the;--work of our -f-ire department,
through this medium.
Establish Urban Renewal Agency
The Freeport urban Renewal Agency, which was ap-proved
last summer by the New York State Legisla-ture,
became a reality on February 7th when the
Village Board voted to make it an official body.
Mayor Sweeney reiterated his previous statements
that these actions do not in any way commit the
village to a renewal project. A public referendum
will decide whether or not a project will be under-taken,
and this vote is expected to take place by
the end of this year, according to Urban Renewal
Director Stanley J. Rotn.
Mayor Sweeney has requested the help of all com-munity
organizations in the drive. He said in his
to civic leaders, &quot;We would like you to
us in a large scale effort to obtain blood
in our village - to establish a bloodline to
in Viet Nam, and incidentally demonstrate to
letter

fices they are making for us.&quot;

The blood donations will be taken by the Inter-
County Blood Bank on April 28th and 29th, between
the hours of 2:OO and 8:&#x27;JO p.m. The life saving
blood will be released to the military as required.
If you&quot; wish to be one of the contributors, please
fill in the registration form on page three of this
bulletin and mail it to the Village Hall.
The idea for the drive was conceived by Freeporters
G. Aver ill Crane, John Abbate, Robert Courtenay,
William Killea and Vincent Barry. All of them were
named to the steering committee, with Mr. Crane and
Mr. Abbate as co-chairmen.

Interchange Agreement For Electricity
Land For Park Use • •-
Acting on the recommendation of the Planning Board
the Board of Trustees has initiated an application
for state aid towards the acquisition for park
purposes of a five acre parcel of waterfront
property. The site, at West End Avenue and Florence
Avenue, is privately owned and zoned industrial.
It is hoped that as much as 87.5% of the land cost
may be obtained in state and federal aid.
Blood Donations For Vietnam Wounded
If you wish to donate blood to aid United States
servicemen wounded in Vietnam, please call
FR 8-1344 any time of day or night. Leave your
name, address and telephone number with the 24 hour
answering service. You will receive compLete instruc-tions
for the blood donations on April 28th and 29th,
or a separate appointment will be made for you at the
blood bank to suit your convenience. The blood, drive,
sponsored by the village in cooperation with the mili-tary
services, was initiated in response to res-idents&#x27;
request- that our community demonstrate to our men in
service that we do appreciate the many sacrifices
they are making for us. The need for a civilian source
of life saving blood has been pointed up by officials
in the federal government as well as by those who have
been treating the wounded in metropolitan area hospi-tals.
In the first few weeks of the drive, which be-gan
in February, two hundred persons registered their
desire to donate blood, including many from other
communities.
A new five year contract with the public utility,
effective April 1, has been signed by Mayor
Sweeney with the unanimous approval of the
Village Board, to provide electricity beyond the
60% of total requirements generated by our muni-cipal
power plant. As a result of the amicable
agreement negotiated with the utility the village
will save $40,000 to $50,000 annually on the old
rates, as reported by Electric Utilities Superin-tendent
Ludovic Long. The new contract in no way
affects the decision. made by the Board, after the
massive regional blackout last November, to build
towards 100% electrical production. Continuing
studies in that direction are being made by the
superintendent and consulting engineers. The goal
is to achieve lower electrical rates for all Free-port
consumers, by expanding our generating capac-ity
and cooperating in an interchange system with
the private power companies.
Oppose A^j.antic Expressway
A survey by Village Engineer Walter Pope and
Treasurer&#x27;Leonard D.B; Smith found that a proposal
to bui&quot;-ld a 14 lane elevated expressway on Sunrise
Highway, if acted upon by state author.!ties, would
cause • serious economic damage to the village&#x27;. The
