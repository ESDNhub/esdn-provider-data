<dc:title>Hiawatha Lake in Onondaga Park Postcard</dc:title>
<dc:description>Lake Hiawatha was originally a city reservoir with rip-rapped stone sides and adjoined to an Oak and Hickory grove. This was a popular place for picnicking, swimming and fishing. The reservoir was soon transformed into a lake and lagoon and the whole area landscaped with planting and roads. An annual fishing derby every summer is a popular event for families from nearby towns. Beaches along the lake offer residents an area to relax and sun- bathe.</dc:description>

Hiawatha Lake was named in memory of a great Chief of the Iroquois Indians whose legendary home was near the present site of the City of Syracuse. The lake is used as a public swimming pool in summer and as a skating rink in winter.
