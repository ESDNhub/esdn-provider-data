<dc:title>Albany Law School on State Street 1879-1926</dc:title>
<dc:description>Albany Law School was located on State Street from 1879-1926. This is a picture of the law school when it was located on State Street. Originally the building was a Universalist Church (the steeple was removed between 1890-1907). There are two bigger buidlings on each side of the school. There is a small tree planted in front of the building with a smooth sidewalk.  Although the date is unknown for the picture it is probably a post 1907 picture. An earlier picture showed no tree and the sidewalk was made of stone slabs.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Picture of Albany Law School in 1935</dc:title>
<dc:description>In 1935 the picture of the law school was taken across the street from the top of a building. One can see part of the structure of the roof of the building in the picture. It is unknown as to what this building was at the time. The picture shows several cars on both Holland and New Scotland Avenue.The law school building can be described as a Gothic stone building.  A tennis court can be seen peaking out from behind the school. It looks like the picture was taken on a rainy day. There is writing on the back of the picture indicating it was a new picture of the school and it was taken for a Mr. Spaulding. It is possible that the picture may have been taken for a Fred H. Spaulding who graduated in 1900 from the law school. He is listed in the Albany Law School Alumni Directory for 1949.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Albany Law School Journal</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Albany Law School Journal v. 1 no. 17 was published on April 13, 1876. One sees from the cover of the newspaper several ads for local businesses selling everything from books, stationary, portrait photography, hats, cigars, and shirts. There is a brief review of a book on   English Law that is priced at $13.00 on the upper right side of the newspaper. This is the only issue that survives to this day. Today the original is hanging in the Albany Law Review Office. A photograph of the front page was taken for inclusion in the book &quot;Albany Law School a Tradition of Change 1851-2001&quot; by Elizabeth K Allen and Diana S. Waite. The Albany Law School Journal is given credit by some as being the first student edited legal periodical. This is a photograph of the front page of the Albany Law School Journal.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Albany Law School Library Reading Room 1968</dc:title>
<dc:description>In 1968 a photograph was taken of the Albany Law School Library and labeled on the back of the picture &quot;Library Reading Room.&quot; The library consisted of a large main floor with an elevated balcony that surrounded the space. Large tables pushed together on the main floor can be seen in the picture with chairs around them.  Library stacks can be seen on both the main floor and the elevated balcony. The picture was taken when the library was empty of people.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Black American Law Students Association 1979 Verdict Picture</dc:title>
<dc:description>The National Black American Law Students Association (BALSA) was founded in 1968. A picture of Albany Law School BALSA members appeared in the 1979 Verdict Yearbook. The five members pictured included Linda Davis (front row left), Karen Cochrane (front row right), Gaspar Castillo (back row left), David Bray (back row center), and Sylvia Ash (back row right). In the 1979 Verdict Yearbook it stated that &quot;BALSA includes within its membership all identifiable minority students who wish to  contribute their unique perspectives to the broader school community in a positive way.&quot; In 1983 to better incorporate students of differing ethnic backgrounds the National organization of BALSA became BLSA (Black Law Students Association). It is unclear exactly what year BLSA was founded at Albany Law School, but it has been established that it was sometime between 1971-1974.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Albany Law Student Wives Association</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Albany Law Students Wives Association was created in 1957. A picture along with some written text about the association appears in the 1957 Verdict Yearbook.  Claire Ruslander is the President, Joan Endres is the Treasurer, and Pat Brown is the Vice-President. Their names are listed above the picture that was taken of the association along with Joan Henry who was making a Decorations Committee report. It is unclear where the women are each sitting in the picture, but it looks like the four women along the wall must be Claire Ruslander, Joan Endres, Pat Brown, and Joan Henry. The rest of the women are sitting at several tables facing the four women sitting along the back wall. Over the years the Law Student Wives Association was also called Law Wives Club or Law Wives. The Student Wives Association was responsible for decorations for various school dances and parties. In the spring the wives held a fashion show. The Student Wives Association lasted from 1957 to about 1972. The demise of the of the Student Wives Association might be the result of changing times as more women started to enter the work force. One could even see a change in the 1972 Verdict Yearbook of an increase of women attending the law school.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The Men&#x27;s Lounge at Albany Law School</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Men&#x27;s Lounge was used by both faculty and students at Albany Law School. In the picture one can see leather chairs, tables, water fountain, ashtrays, clock, windows (right side), and pictures on the wall around the room.  There are five men sitting in the room with two on the left side, two on the right, and one on the back wall.  All of the men appear to be reading newspapers or magazines. The faculty and students used the room to read and watch sports on television. This picture does not show a television, but at some point there was one brought in and used. There are other pictures of the men&#x27;s lounge in the various Verdict Yearbooks showing the men watching television or reading. The picture was taken by a commercial photographer from Glen S. Cook and Son.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Letter from Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson to Andrew V. Clements the Dean of Albany Law School</dc:title>
<dc:description>Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote the Dean of Albany Law School Andrew Clements. The letter had the Supreme Court of the United States Washington D.C. at the top and on the left side it had the Chambers of Robert H. Jackson as the letterhead. The letter was typewritten with the hand written signature of Justice Jackson and dated May 7, 1951. Jackson was a member of the class of 1912 at Albany Law School. In the letter Jackson discusses coming to Albany on June 1, 1951, but that he would probably have to return to Washington that day. Jackson was being honored by the law school with the degree of Doctor of Laws at the Albany Law School Graduation Ceremony on June 1st. The law school was also celebrating on June 1-2, 1951 the Centennial of Albany Law&#x27;s founding. Justice Jackson was famous for having been part of the Nuremberg Trials after World War II. He was on the Supreme Court for the landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools in 1954.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Albany Law School Auditorium</dc:title>
<dc:description>Here is a picture of the Albany Law School Auditorium that is also a gymnasium. The stage can be seen in the picture with a podium, table, and several chairs on it. An American flag can be seen on the stage on the left side where there are stairs leading up to the stage. A picture of Harold Alexander (Dean of the law school from 1924-1945) can be seen to the left of the stage and another picture to right of the stage of General Thomas H. Hubbard class of 1861 whose family left money for construction of the gym and who is best known for drafting the 1908 ABA canons of legal ethics. Wooden chairs are lined up facing the stage for some unknown event. The auditorium was used for the Albany Law School graduation ceremonies in the past. A basketball net and floor markings indicate the use of the gym for athletic events. Albany Law School had a Basketball team  called the Law Men. In 1920 Albany Law School&#x27;s basketball team beat both Boston University and St John&#x27;s. From the 1920&#x27;s-1930&#x27;s the basketball team was intercollegiate. After the 1930&#x27;s the team participated in  more intramural basketball.</dc:description>

<dc:title>1890 Letter from the Dean of Albany Law School George W. Kirchwey to a Mr. Warfield</dc:title>
<dc:description>George Kirchwey the Dean of Albany Law School wrote a handwritten letter dated August 13, 1890 to a Mr. Warfield. In the letter Dean Kirchwey discusses providing Mr. Warfield a student with a certificate and praises his excellent work. The student was George R. Warfield listed in the catalog of 1889-1890. A student could study law for a year and apply for a certificate that counted toward a clerkship that allowed him to take the bar exam. The New York Court of Appeals revised the rules for admission to the Bar in 1911. The new requirements allowed for four years of study or for those that graduated from college admittance after three years of study. Albany Law School after the court revisions passed a resolution requiring three years of study for a LL. B. degree, and ended the certificate privilege.</dc:description>
